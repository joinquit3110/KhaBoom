   - Added CORS configuration for security

2. **API Security and Performance**
   - Improved CORS configuration with origin validation
   - Added better security headers
   - Added proper error handling with middleware

3. **Status Monitoring**
   - Added `/api/status` endpoint for monitoring
   - Added detailed health check endpoint
   - Created MongoDB connection status reporting

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Added `start.sh` script for Render deployment
   - Created `Procfile` for process management
   - Added environment-specific configurations

## Frontend Changes

### Netlify Integration

1. **Netlify Configuration Files**
   - Enhanced `netlify.toml` with proper build settings and environments
   - Updated `_redirects` for SPA routing
   - Enhanced `_headers` for security and caching

2. **Build Process Enhancements**
   - Created improved build script with better error handling
   - Added `postbuild.js` for final optimizations
   - Created static assets for SEO (robots.txt, sitemap.xml)

3. **API Integration**
   - Created `api.js` service for centralized API communication
   - Added proper error handling for API requests
   - Created connection monitoring utility

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Added environment-specific configuration files
   - Updated environment variables for different deployment environments
   - Added connection fallbacks for better reliability

## Documentation Updates

1. **Deployment Guides**
   - Created comprehensive deployment guide
   - Added API testing documentation
   - Updated README.md with deployment instructions

2. **MongoDB Integration Documentation**
   - Added MongoDB connection documentation

   - Added indexes and performance documentation

3. **Setup Instructions**
   - Updated environment setup documentation
   - Added environment variables documentation
   - Created local development setup guide

## Security Enhancements

1. **API Security**
   - Improved CORS configuration to restrict origins
   - Added proper security headers
   - Enhanced JWT authentication

2. **Frontend Security**
   - Added content security policy headers
   - Implemented strict transport security
   - Added XSS protection headers

3. **Database Security**

   - Added caching headers for static content

2. **Frontend Performance**
   - Added cache-control headers for static assets
   - Optimized build process for faster loading
   - Added gzip/brotli compression support

## Testing

1. **API Testing**
   - Created API testing documentation
   - Added MongoDB connection testing script
   - Created index creation verification script

2. **Deployment Testing**
   - Added Netlify deploy verification steps
   - Created Render deployment verification
   - Added MongoDB connection verification

## Summary

These changes ensure that the KhaBoom application is properly configured to work with:

1. **Netlify** for frontend hosting with proper SPA routing, security, and optimizations
2. **Render** for backend API hosting with robust configuration and monitoring
3. **MongoDB Atlas** for database hosting with proper connection handling, security, and performance optimizations

The application is now ready for deployment to these platforms with proper configuration and best practices implemented.
