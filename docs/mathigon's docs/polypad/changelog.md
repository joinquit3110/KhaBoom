## v4.0 (12 July 2022)

This is a significant and backwards-compatibility-breaking change to the Polypad API. We have
significantly the internal change tracking and storage modal for Polypad tiles. There are three
important differences:

* Tiles and strokes are now stored in a map/object keyed by their ID, rather than in an array. This
  applies to both the serialized Polypad JSON, and the data passed to change events.
* The `options` of a tile are now broken up into multiple, typed properties, rather than a single
  string. More details about these new properties can be found at https://mathigon.io/polypad/tiles.
* The `colour` property of tiles or strokes has been renamed to `color`, the `order` property has
  been renamed to `layer`, and the `flipped` property has been renamed to `isFlipped`. The `hidden`,
  `locked` and `fixed` properties have been combined into a single `status` property.
* Some tile names have changed from `algebra-tile` to `algebra` and from `pentomino` to `polyomino`.
  The `grid` tile is no longer supported, and the `pentagon` tile is now just a normal `polygon` tile.
* Change events are much more granular, returning only the tile properties that have changed, rather than the whole object.

Together, these changes allow us to make very significant performance improvements, and enable a
number of upcoming features. We have a [migration script](https://static.mathigon.org/api/migration.js)
that can be used to update any existing, stored Polypad data. The updated data will have a
`version: 2` property for identification.

### Breaking Changes

* The structure of the `TileData`, `StrokeData` and `PolypadData` interfaces, `.paste()` arguments
  and `.on('change')` callback arguments have changed. See above for details.
* Updated colour scheme for number cards and number tiles, to be more consistent across tile types.
* Keyboard events (e.g. CTRL+Z to undo) are now bound just to the Polypad instance, rather than
  `document` and won't be triggered unless Polypad is focussed. Losing focus also clears the
  currentl selection. We have enabled many additional keyboard events that previously were not
  available in the API. They are now enabled using a new `.bindKeyboardEvents()` method, rather
  than a `bindKeyboardEvents?: boolean` property during setup (which has been removed). You can
  even customise some of the key bindings.

### New Features

* Ability to "tabulate" probability tiles (e.g. dice) and show their data in a table.
* Ability to resize the "x" and "y" values for algebra tiles, using sliders in the sidebar.
* Merge action for number bars.
* Split actions for number cards.
* Actions to quickly create charts linked to tables.
* Degree label while rotating tiles.
* Temporarily enable the "pan" tool while holding the spacebar.

* New `PolypadInstance.destroy()` method to clean up and remove a Polypad instance.
* New `Polypad.toImage()` method that converts JSON to PNG, JPG or SVG without having to create
  a Polypad instance.
* New `Polypad.getCustomiseOptions()` method that returns lists of all available options to
  customise the UI of Polypad.
* New `Polypad.translate()` method that can be used to update text boxes, equations or image URLs
  within Polypad.

### Bug Fixes

* Don't allow students to move, copy or delete question input boxes.
* Correctly compute quartiles and median in box plots with decimal data.
* Hide action bar for question builder tiles (in student mode).
* Fix issues with playing cards and coins in exported SVG files.
* Correctly set focus on the Polypad DOM element when clicking the canvas.


## v3.6 (13 May 2022)

### Fixes

* Fix loading error when `teacherMode` is not enabled.


## v3.5 (12 May 2022)

### New Features

* Coin tiles for USD, EUR and GBP.
* Support fraction, percentage and π multiple labels for number lines and coordinate axes.
* New random number generator tiles with many different discrete and continuous distributions.
* New `.paste()` utility for Polypad instances. Unlike `.add()`, this de-dupes any tile IDs, dynamic
  geometry keys and connection cables, so that the same data can be pasted multiple times.
* Width and height labels for number tiles.
* New `.isTeacher` property when setting up a new canvas, which allows users to add editable question fields to the canvas.
* New "fill" button for number frames.

### Breaking Changes

* The size of `number-card` tiles has been reduced from 75x75 px to 50x50 px, to be more consistent
  with other tiles and the grid background.

### Fixes

* Hide question field answers when generating thumbnails.
* Many bug fixes with copy+paste (including cables and dynamic geometry tiles).
* Improved point ordering for un-sorted line/area chart series.
* Center new tiles that are being dragged from the sidebar.
* Fix bug with storing the active side of some polyhedral dice.

* Fix copy+paste for dynamic geometry tiles.
* Fix action bar positioning for dynamic geometry tiles.
* Fix keyboard shortcuts for toolbar buttons.


## v3.3 (24 February 2022)

### Breaking Changes

* The `.pngImage()` method has been renamed to `.image()` and accepts and additional `type` argument
  that can be PNG, JPG or SVG. PNG exports now have a transparent background, rather than white.
* Reorganised "polygons" section in the sidebar, with new tools. Hide 10 and 12-sided regular
  polygons (these can be created manually using the new generic "regular polygon" tile).

### New Features

* New "rectangle" and "regular polygon" tiles that can be customised.
* New gemetry tool for drawing angles.
* Ability to add labels to dynamic geometry elements (including their current value)
* Export canvas as JPG or SVG, in addition to PNG.

### Fixes

* Lots of dynamic geometry fixes when deleting, snapping, or undo/redoing.
* Hide "flip" button for symmetric polygons that are not rotated.


## v3.2 (17 February 2022)

### Breaking Changes

* The "grid" and "settings" panels in the settings bar have changed significantly – see below.
* Tile weights for the balance scale components are now stored in `.options.tileWeights` rather than
  the options strings for each individual balance scale. This used to cause various bugs with
  multiple balance scales on the same canvas.

### New Features

* New panel to customise the UI of Polypad and select which features are available. Some options
  from the old settings panel have moved into the "grid" selection panel (e.g. editing hidden tiles
  or resetting the viewport).
* New mode for editing locked or hidden tiles.
* Reset the Polypad viewport when exiting fullscreen mode.
* New geometry tool for drawing rectangles.
* Support fraction bar denominators up to 32.
* New `.showGesture()` method to help with building onboarding flows.

### Fixes

* Fix loading of initial Polypad options when instantiating API (e.g. grid).
* XSS escaping for content of rich text boxes.
* Fix multiple SVG display bugs in Safari (compass, spinners, and number line).
* Fix label type when splitting fraction bars into multiple segments.
* Hide the actionbar when no valid actions are selected.
* Improved snapping when moving geometry construction paths.


## v3.1 (7 February 2022)

### Breaking Changes

* Replace the canvas-wide `labelType` and `noLabels` options with a tile-specific `labels` option.
  You can now have tiles with multiple different label types on the same canvas, and there is a new
  selector for fraction bars and circles.

### Fixes

* Fix equation editor tool selection
* Fix initial loading of cached options


## v3.0 (4 February 2022)

### Breaking Changes

* Significantly improved options handling, with many additional ways to customise the UI and
  features of Polypad:
  * All options (e.g. `grid`, `noLabels`, `altColors`, `mergeTiles` and `evalEquations`) are now
    grouped under a `PolypadData.options` object.
  * New `toolbar`, `settings`, `sidebar` and `actionbar` options can be used to show only a subset
    of available tiles or buttons in the UI, using a comma-separated string.
  * Additional options for `noCopyPaste`, `noUndoRedo`, `noPinchPan`, `noDeleting`, `noAudio`,
    `noRotating` and  `noSnapping`.
  * The `.setGrid()` method and the `.on('grid')` event have been removed. You can now just use the
    `.setOptions()` method and the `.on('options')` event.
  * The `noPanAndZoom` property has been removed when setting up Polypad, and is now an option
    that can be changed dynamically, like the ones above.
* New __Action Bar__ that floats under your current selection of tiles or can be pinned to the
  bottom. This can be used to customise properties of the tile, or apply actions.

### New Features

* Logic gate tiles, including switches, flip-flops and light bulbs, for learning computer science.
* Significantly improved snapping and drawing logic, including snapping to intersections or paths
  generated using the ruler or protractor utensils. The `Stroke.points` property can now be both
  an SVG path string or a geometric expression like `segment(point(1,1),point(2,2))`.
* Inches units for ruler, updated labels for ruler and protractor.
* Advanced option to hide the "handles" for different tiles (`TileData.hideHandles`).
* The table and coordinate system icons now appear both in the "algebra" and "data science" sections
  of the sidebar.

### Fixes

* Fix undo/redo events when adding geo points that snap to existing constructions.
* Split number tiles first into rows, then into individual tiles.
* Various improvements to the linking system (styling and UX tweaks).
* Various performance improvements and reduced JS bundle size.
* Updated "copy" icon.


## v2.3 (3 January 2022)

### Breaking Changes

* Changed the order and position of some sidebar items. Coordinate systems and sliders are now in
  the "Algebra" selection, while the number line is now in the "Numbers" section. The last
  section has been renamed to "Games and Applications" and contains a number of new features.
* Updated "linking" system that now allows the same tile (e.g. table or equation) to be linked to
  multiple other tiles (e.g. a coordinate system). The link data is now stored as an array in the
  `cables` property of `TileData`, rather than the previous `link` string. For any existing, saved
  Polypad canvases, `link: 'abc'` needs to be converted to `cables: [{toTileId: 'abc'}]`.

### New Features

* Create scatter plots that can be created by linkin a table to a coordinate system.
* New chessboard and chess pieces tiles, including move hints.
* New "ten-frame" tile and two-sided counters.
* New number line multiples jumps tile.
* New resize handle for the balance scale plates.
* Sound effects when applying certain actions (e.g. rolling a die)
* Double-click on a function or scatter plot in the coordinate system to change its colour.
* Keyboard shortcuts for bold/italic/underlined in rich text boxes.

### Fixes

* Correctly apply tile transformations when a tile's position is changed by another tile (e.g. the balance scale or bucket of zero).
* Fix tile transforms if the x or y coordinates are 0. (This could happen after curring unfolded 3D nets.)
* When copying a geometric construction, include all dependency points in the change event data (e.g. the center point when copying a circle).
* Improved parsing of equations involving implicit multiplication or mixed numbers.
* Add XSS escaping for table tiles.


## v2.2 (24 November 2021)

### New Features

* 3D Polyhedra folding

  * The undo and redo button now only apply to actions by the user, not to tiles added or modified programatically
  * The `.on('change')` event now returns arrays with the previous and updated state of tiles that have changed

### New Features

* Significantly improved undo/redo and serialisation performance

* Fix bugs when deleting dots in dot machine
* Fix bugs where the dice options value doesn't match the visible face


## v1.6

### New Features

* Return full stroke data in `change` events (no more max-length). Add options for max number of tiles, strokes and stroke length in `.serialize()` method.
* Add `.preventDefault()` to `undo` and `redo` events.
* New `options` event for the alternate colours and number labels settings, as well as a `.setOptions()` method to change these values programatically.
* New `.toggleSidebar()` method to expand or collapse the sidebar.
* New `.addCustomButton()` method to create custom toolbar or settings bar buttons.
* Paste images directly from the clipboard onto the canvas.

### Fixes

* Don't delete tiles when clicking backspace inside an input field (e.g. the number line or exploding dots settings fields).
* Trigger correct event (`added`, not `changed`) when creating text or equation tiles.
* Fix bugs when changing the number of exploding dots machine boxes.
* Correctly center pasted tiles on the canvas, even when the sidebar is open.
* Fix some bugs when pressing escape or shift keys while dragging tiles.
* Fix erasing and positioning of fraction circle tiles.
* Fix change event data for Abacus tile and equation boxes


## v1.5

### Breaking Changes

* The `'move'` event is now triggered continuously, rather than throttled to once every second.

### New Features

* New `noPanAndZoom` parameter when setting up a Polypad instance.
* Support text selection within equation editor

### Fixes

* Fixed ID generation and change events for Abakus and Equation tiles
* Fixed positioning of tile settings panels (e.g. for numerline)
* Trigger `change` when erasing with a single click (rather than click and drag)
* Trigger `delete`, rather than `change`, when deleting a text box by making its content `''`.
