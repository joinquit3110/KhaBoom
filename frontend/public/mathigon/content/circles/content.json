Include the relationship between central, inscribed, and circumscribed\nangles; inscribed angles on a diameter are right angles; the radius of a circle\nis perpendicular to the tangent where the radius intersects the circle.__\n\nAn inscribed angle is an angle with its vertex is the circle and its sides\ncontain chords. The intercepted arc is the arc that is on the interior of the\ninscribed angle and whose endpoints are on the angle. The vertex of an inscribed\nangle can be anywhere on the circle as long as its sides intersect the circle to\nform an intercepted arc.\n\n__Inscribed Angle Theorem__\nThe measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\nTo prove the Inscribed Angle Theorem, you would need to split it up into three\ncases, like the three different angles drawn from the Investigation.\n\n__Congruent Inscribed Angle Theorem__\nInscribed angles that intercept the same arc are congruent.\n\n__Inscribed Angle Semicircle Theorem__\nAn angle that intercepts a semicircle is a right angle.\n\nIn the Inscribed Angle Semicircle Theorem we could also say that the angle is\ninscribed in a semicircle. Anytime a right angle is inscribed in a circle, the\nendpoints of the angle are the endpoints of a diameter. Therefore, the converse\nof the Inscribed Angle Semicircle Theorem is also true.\n\nWhen an angle is on a circle, the vertex is on the circumference of the circle.\nOne type of angle on a circle is one formed by a tangent and a chord.\n\n__Chord/Tangent Angle Theorem__\nThe measure of an angle formed by a chord and a tangent that intersect on the\ncircle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\nFrom the Chord/Tangent Angle Theorem, we now know that there are two types of\nangles that are half the measure of the intercepted arc; an inscribed angle and\nan angle formed by a chord and a tangent. Therefore, any angle with its vertex\non a circle will be half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\nAn angle is considered inside a circle when the vertex is somewhere inside the\ncircle, but not on the center. All angles inside a circle are formed by two\nintersecting chords.\n\n__Intersecting Chords Angle Theorem__\nThe measure of the angle formed by two chords that intersect inside a circle is\nthe average of the measure of the intercepted arcs.\n\nAn angle is considered to be outside a circle if the vertex of the angle is\noutside the circle and the sides are tangents or secants. There are three types\nof angles that are outside a circle: an angle formed by two tangents, an angle\nformed by a tangent and a secant, and an angle formed by two secants. Just like\nan angle inside or on a circle, an angle outside a circle has a specific\nformula, involving the intercepted arcs.\n\n__Outside Angle Theorem__\nThe measure of an angle formed by two secants, two tangents, or a secant and a\ntangent drawn from a point outside the circle is equal to half the difference\nof the measures of the intercepted arcs.\n\nWhen two chords intersect inside a circle, the two triangles they create are\nsimilar, making the sides of each triangle in proportion with each other. If we\nremove AD and BC the ratios between AE, EC, DE, and EB will still be the same.\n\n__Intersecting Chords Theorem__\nIf two chords intersect inside a circle so that one is divided into segments of\nlength a and b and the other into segments of length c and d then ab=cd. In\nother words, the product of the segments of one chord is equal to the product\nof segments of the second chord.\n\nIn addition to forming an angle outside of a circle, the circle can divide the\nsecants into segments that are proportional with each other.\n\nIf we draw in the intersecting chords, we will have two similar triangles.\n\nFrom the inscribed angles and the Reflexive Property (∠R≅∠R),△PRS∼△TRQ. Because\nthe two triangles are similar, we can set up a proportion between the\ncorresponding sides. Then, cross-multiply. ac+d=ca+b⇒a(a+b)=c(c+d)\n\n__Two Secants Segments Theorem__\nIf two secants are drawn from a common point outside a circle and the segments\nare labeled as above, then a(a+b)=c(c+d). In other words, the product of the\nouter segment and the whole of one secant is equal to the product of the outer\nsegment and the whole of the other secant.\n\nIf a tangent and secant meet at a common point outside a circle, the segments\ncreated have a similar relationship to that of two secant rays. Recall that the\nproduct of the outer portion of a secant and the whole is equal to the same of\nthe other secant. If one of these segments is a tangent, it will still be the\nproduct of the outer portion and the whole. However, for a tangent line, the\nouter portion and the whole are equal.\n\n__Tangent Secant Segment Theorem__\nIf a tangent and a secant are drawn from a common point outside the circle (and\nthe segments are labeled like the picture to the left), then a2=b(b+c). This\nmeans that the product of the outside segment of the secant and the whole is\nequal to the square of the tangent segment."
