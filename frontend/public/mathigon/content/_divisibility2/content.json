Upon correct answer, add two more blank rows to the table. Check this pattern by entering in two more numbers into the table. Upon entering those numbers: The patterns hold true - the final answer is always divisible by 9. In fact, you may notice that the final answer is always 9 times the number in the tens place of the starting number.\n\n{.fixme} Now look at the number chart. Show the chart again with a “refresh” button below it. Highlight all the multiples of 9. Upon clicking, All symbols next to these numbers are [[the same | different]]. Refresh the chart a few times.

Therefore, whatever picture you are thinking of (as long as you do the subtraction correctly!) is one of the symbols next to a [[multiple | factor]] of 9. Upon correct answer:\n\n{.fixme} Let’s end the chapter by proving that the final number in this process is always a multiple of 9. You started with any two-digit number. Let’s call this number AB.\n\n{.fixme} AB = 10 groups of [[A]] + 1 group of [[B]].\n\n{.fixme} Upon correct answer. Then, you added the two digits together: A + [[B]]. This is 1 group of A and 1 group of B. Finally, you subtracted this from the starting number:\n\t= 10 groups of A + 1 group of B - 1 group of A - 1 group of B\n\t= [[9]] groups of A + [[0]] groups of B\n\n{.fixme} Upon correct answer:\nThe final result is 9 groups of A. A is the number in the [[tens | ones]] place of the starting number. 9 × A will always be a multiple of 9 so we’ve proven that the final number in this series of calculations will indeed be divisible by 9, no matter what 2-digit number you start with!\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n## Prime Numbers\n\n\n::: column(width=116)\n\n    x-image-sequence(image=\"url(images/ishango.jpg)\" tiles=\"21,4\" size=\"116,400\")\n    x-gesture(target=\"x-image-sequence\" slide=\"60,0\")\n\n::: column.grow\n\nThe __Ishango bone__ is more than 20,000 years old, and one of the few remaining _composite tools_\nfrom prehistoric times.

Each prime factor should be an actual ball that acts as a physics object so when one comes out of the machine, the other gumballs kind of fall down into place in the machine.\n\nAdditionally, the same set up gumballs would move with students down the screen throughout the entire chapter. Later in the chapter, they can just type in primes instead of clicking the handles of the machine. But I would still want a ball from the machine to quickly be released or pop (like a bubble) each time they use a prime factor.\n\nWhen a given machine is empty (they’ve used all 2’s or something), they need to click “Refill.” Maybe we can have an animation of a cartoon character carrying a box or or sack of 2’s and they open the top of the machine and dump them in. This may seem goofy or elementary and maybe not worth the coding time, but I really do think it helps this age student build deep connections and fundamental understanding of the underlying concept that prime factors are the building blocks of numbers and the idea of combining them to make composite numbers. I think the brain connections being made as the see the machine slowly being depleted and then filled up as needed really do help construct meaning for students.\n\nWhen students click on the next prime number to be dropped into place, that number gets added to the first one. When their sum gets to 14, the problem becomes grouped in a colored box and there is a “Ding” sound effect. Then, they make some more.\n\n2\tand then\t2 + 5\t\tand then\t2 + 5 + 7\n\nAtter correctly finding one, a tutor comment says, “Great!

Sliced like this, the cake can serve [[308]] people!\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n## Lowest Common Multiples\n\n\n### Cicadas\n\nNorth America is home to various broods, or groups, of cicadas. Each brood has the curious property that the cicadas in that brood only emerge every few years during the summer to breed - the remaining time is spent underground in an immature, nymph-like state. There are 12 different broods that emerge every 17 years and 3 different broods that emerge every 13 years, however they don’t all come out in the same year.\n\nOne of the 13-year broods of Cicadas lives in Mississippi. Imagine they emerged this year. In the grid below, start clicking on the number of years from now in which these cicadas will emerge again:\n\nThis is the same 1-100 number chart from the Prime Numbers chapter. There could be a hovering hand showing them to click 13 and then 26 and then students will continue clicking every other multiple of 13. Once students, click 52, the rest become highlighted automatically.\n\nAs we learned in the Factors and Multiples chapter, the numbers you just selected (13, 26, 39, 52, 65 and so on) are the [[multiples | factors]] of 13. Enter in some of the multiples of 5, 8 and 12 below\n\nAs students fill in the numbers below, the multiples of each number will be highlighted in a different color in another 1-100 grid as shown below. Students don’t have to fill in all the multiples below. Those that are given will already be highlighted in the appropriate color. Numbers that are common multiples of a pair of number will be highlighted with both of the colors - the circle will be split in half, with one color on each half. Maybe the lists below can be something like this from the Sequences and Patterns Introduction course.\n\nMultiples of 5:\n5, [[10]], [[15]], 20, 25, 30, [[35]], 40, 45, 50, [[55]], [[60]], [[65]], 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, [[100]]...\n\nMultiples of 8\n[[8]], 16, [[24]], 32, 40, [[48]], [[56]], [[64]], 72, 80, [[88]], 96...\n\nMultiples of 12\n12, 24, [[36]], [[48]], [[60]], 72, 84, [[96]]\n\nUnlike factors of numbers, the list of multiples of a number [[continues on forever | stops at 100]]. The numbers with two colors are multiples of two numbers. The first number that is a multiple of both 8 and 12 is [[24]]. The next number that is a multiple of 8 and 12 is [[48]]. The first number that is a multiple of 5 and 12 is [[60]]. These are called common multiples and the first one is called the least common multiple (LCM)."

      "content": "Let’s return to thinking about the cicadas that emerge every 13 years.\n\nShow the 1-100 grid again with the multiples of 13 in one color.\n\nResearch into cicadas suggests that, over millions of years, they have evolved to emerging on these cycles to avoid predators. Imagine one predator that eats cicadas emerges every 6 years. Click below to highlight the years in which the predators emerge.\n\nStudents will click play on a button that will highlight all the multiples of 6 in a different color than the multiples of 13. It would be a nice visual if each multiple could change color one at a time, in order, rather than every multiple appearing in a different color all at once. Again, here’s the grid without the highlights.\n\nThe cicadas and the predators match up only once in 100 years - [[78]] years from now. This is the [[least common multiple | greatest common factor]] of 13 and 6. The cicadas will emerge 5 times before they emerge at the same time as their predators.\n\nUpon correct answer:\nImagine instead that the cicadas emerge every 12 years. Click below to show the years in which these cicadas would emerge.\n\nNow, when students click the animation, the multiples of 13 will fade away and the multiples of 12 will show up in a different color. Again, it would be a nice visual if each multiple could change color one at a time, in order, rather than every multiple appearing in a different color all at once. The end state will be this grid with all the multiples of 6 and 12 highlighted. Obviously, every multiple of 12 will be two-toned with each color taking up half the circle.\n\nIn this scenario, every time the cicadas emerge, the predators also emerge! Every multiple of 12 [[is also | is not]] a common multiple of 6. So, emerging every 13 years is much more beneficial to the cicadas then emerging every 12 years. Of course, the cicadas didn’t plan this - they have evolved over time into this cycle.\n\nIn the next section, the 13 is a slider that goes from 4 to 20 like the slider in the current LCM chapter. As students move the slider, the “1” changes to the LCM of 6 and the number in the slider and the 1-100 grid (maybe we need a new one below this text) also changes to highlight the multiples of the number in the slider. The grid still has the multiples of 6 highlighted for the predator and any number that is a common multiple of the number in the slider and 6 shows up in both colors. Here, it’s fine for just the multiples to appear all at once in the grid as students move the slider - the multiples don’t need to show up one by one as they did before.\nA 13 year cycle creates 1 time(s) in 100 years in which the cicadas would emerge at the same time as the predators. Move the slider to see how other cycles match up with predators that appear every 6 years. For two possible cicada cycles, the cicadas and the predators don’t meet at all in 100 years - a [[17]] year cycle and a  [[19]] year cycle. We’ll learn more about what’s unique about these numbers in the next chapter!"

In order for the red dots to line up again, the blue gear made [[3]] full revolutions and the gray one made [[4]].\n\n\tBlue: 8 teeth × 3 revolutions = [[24]]\n\tGray: 6 teeth × 4 revolutions = [[24]].\n\nYou may recall from the chapter GCF and LCM Introduction, that 24 is the [[ LCM | GCF ]] of 8 and 6. In that chapter, to find the LCM of a set of numbers, we just listed the multiples of each and found the smallest one common to both.\n\nShow a gear animation again - this time one with 9 and 15 teeth. Like above, have a counter with the number of revolutions each gear is making, but also add a list of the multiples of each number. So, as the counter for the gear with 9 teeth goes up by 1 each time, the next multiple of 9 is added to the list. So, the end state would look like this:\n\nGray Gear - 9 Teeth\nFull Revolutions: 5\nMultiples of 9: 0, 9, 18, 27, 36, 45\n\nBlue Gear - 15 Teeth\nFull Revolutions: 3\nMultiples of 15: 0, 15, 30, 45\n\nAfter playing the animation, show the following:\nYou also may recall from the earlier chapter, that sometimes listing the first few multiples of numbers does not reveal a common multiple.

Above, we used the prime factorization to help us calculate the GCF of numbers. Let’s see if we can use prime factorization to also help us with harder to find LCMs.\n\nFirst, find the prime factorization for 18 and 40. This will be the same process as above. It is explained in detail in this chapter. Watch this video for an overview:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10G1OgzEdcdFnE4zmFhSodwLcj66IdyU7/view?usp=sharing\n\nUpon final answer, students will have made the following. Note - unlike in the other chapter, I think it is worthwhile here to have the prime factors labeled in the sections around the number:\n\nUpon finding the correct prime factorization, show the following.\nAs we learned in the Prime Factorization chapter, when building multiples a target number, the prime factorization of the multiple must contain all the prime factors of that target number. For example, we see that 40 [[is | is not]] a multiple of 8, because 2 × 2 × 2 is in the prime factorization of 40. Upon correct answer, show an arrow going from the “2 × 2 × 2” in the text to three “2”s in the prime factorization ring of 40. Similarly, 18 [[is | is not]] a multiple of 6. Upon correct answer, have the “2” and “3” in the prime factorization ring for 18 hover outside or above the ring for a second or two. Then, show the following:\n\nLet’s use this idea to build a number that is a multiple of 18 and 40 while using the fewest prime factors as possible. Remember, we want the [[least | greatest]] common multiple. Upon correct answer, show the two factor rings again and the gumball machine of prime factors:\n\nTo enter a prime factor into the ring, students can either type it to a blank text field in the ring, drag down a section from the rings for 18 and 40, or release a prime factor from the gumball machines.\n\nWatch this video for an overview of the animation:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1nWYjfToDB6ryb6jFujB3eo8NADNbu0bo/view?usp=sharing"

Upon correct answer: So, the LCM of 126 and 45 is [[630]]. We created the LCM using only [[2]] 3’s since both 45 and 126 have 2 3’s in their prime factorization. Additionally, we can see in the diagram that:\n\n126 × [[5]] = 630 and 45 × [[14]] = 630. When students enter in the correct answer, the circle for 126 and 45 become highlighted for a second to show 126 × 5 in the diagram and 45 × 14. Something like this for the two end states:\n\nIn general, to find the GCF, we just multiply the prime factors [[in the overlapping regions | in the outside regions]]. To find the LCM, we must multiply [[all the prime factors in the diagram | just the prime factors NOT in the overlapping region]]."

In face, in the Prime Factorization chapter, we learned about the value of multiplying, not adding, prime numbers.\n\nGoldbach wrote about his observation in a letter to the famous mathematician Leonhard Euler, but neither of them was able to prove the idea.

And that is a big difference. There are infinitely many integers, so we can’t possibly check them all.\n\nThe simplicity of this idea has made Goldbach’s Conjecture one of the most famous unsolved problems in all of mathematics!

Add rows for N = 11, 12 and 13 to the bottom of the table:\n\n11\n2048\n[[2047]]\n[[Composite | Prime]]\n12\n4096\n4095\n[[Composite | Prime]]\n13\n8192\n8191\n[[Composite | Prime]]\n\nUnfortunately, 2047 is composite. 23 × [[89]] = 2047. So, when N is prime, 2N - 1 is [[sometimes | always | never]] prime. Upon correct answer: Since this sometimes works, mathematicians use this pattern to try to find bigger and bigger prime numbers. Prime numbers of the form 2N - 1 are named Mersenne Primes after French mathematician Marin Mersenne. Mersenne studied these numbers in the early 17th century.\n\nMathematicians know of 51 Mersenne Primes and the current largest known prime number was found using this process. People around the world are using their computers to search for the 52nd Mersenne Prime. You can put your computer to work and maybe find it yourself! Read more about how to get involved at the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search.\n\nLet’s connect together the ideas of Perfect Numbers and Mersenne Primes. Here again are the first 4 perfect numbers and their factors.\n\nNumber\nFactors less than the number\nSum of those factors\n6\n1, 2, 3\n6\n28\n1, 2, 4, 7, 14\n28\n496\n1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, 248\n496\n8196\n1, 2, 5, 8, 16, 32, 64, 127, 254, 508, 1016, 2032, 4064\n8196\n\nLook carefully at the list of factors for each one and click on any factor that is also on the list of Mersenne primes. Students click on 3 (factor of 6), 7 (factor of 28), 31 (factor of 496) and 127 (factor of 8196). Place each number in a red circle or something when students click on it. Upon doing all 4, show the following: Amazingly, all even perfect numbers have a Mersenne primes as a factor! So, when mathematicians discover a new Mersenne prime, they use that prime number to find a new perfect number!\n\nNotice how beautiful and awe-inspiring mathematics can be. Finding patterns in prime numbers (numbers that only have exactly 2 factors) leads to patterns in Perfect Numbers (numbers that have the exact factors that somehow add up to the number itself). Results like this cause mathematicians to continue to search, explore and wonder about other connections and possibilities!"

      "content": "### The Riemann Hypothesis\n\nMathematicians have spent many centuries exploring the pattern and distributions of prime numbers. Primes seem to appear completely randomly - sometimes there are huge gaps in between consecutive primes and sometimes we find twin primes right next to each other.\n\nIn 1792, At age 15, German mathematician [Carl Friedrich Gauss](bio:gauss) had a groundbreaking new idea. He counted the number of primes up a certain point and graphed the results. Complete the table below to see the points show up in the graph:\nStudents enter numbers in the table and then those points show up in the graph. Making the graph a little more interactive can help students understand more what the graph represents. Just looking at the graph in the current chapter may be confusing to some students.\n\nBelow is the start and end state. This video as a quick overview:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1RbckOKp9YXu_zESPqWIZPdmsGk3XemHf/view?usp=sharing\n\nUpon finishing the graph, show the following:\nAs we zoom out , the blue line becomes very smooth.\nUpon zooming out, now include the x/log × function in red on the graph. Then show the following:\nGauss noticed that the shape of the blue line looks very similar to the function x/(log x) (shown in red). He predicted that the two functions are always “approximately similar.” This was proven to be true in 1896.\n\nHowever, as you can see, there is a significant gap between the actual number of primes in blue and Gauss’s approximation in red. In 1859, mathematician [Bernhard Riemann](bio:riemann) discovered an approximation that looked much better, but he wasn’t able to prove that it would always work. His process allows mathematicians to determine how many prime numbers exist between any two numbers. His idea has become known as the Riemann Hypothesis.\n\nHundreds of mathematicians have tried to prove Riemann’s Hypothesis, but all without success. Mathematicians consider it to be one of the most difficult and important unsolved problems in mathematics. In 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute named it one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems and promised $1,000,000 to any mathematician who solves it. Maybe you’ll be part of that team as mathematicians some day as well!"
