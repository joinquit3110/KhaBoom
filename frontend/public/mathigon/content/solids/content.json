I'm excited to see this one in action!\n\n    // Glossary entry - Dimension: Dimensions in mathematics are the measure of the size or distance of an object.\n\nSo far, we’ve only looked at the geometry of flat, 2-dimensional objects like circles or rectangles – but we live in a three-dimensional world. Every object we see or touch has three __dimensions__.\n\n::: column.fit\n\n    figure: x-img(src=\"images/ch1_2.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\")\n\n::: column.grow\n\nA point has zero dimensions. A point just specifies a location but it has no size.\n\nA line has one dimension, we can measure its length (l), but it has no width or thickness.\n\nA square has two dimensions, we can measure its length (l) and, perpendicular to that, its width (w).\n\nA cube has three dimensions, we can measure its length (l); width (w); and perpendicular to both of those dimensions, we have its height (h).\n\n:::"

Even a paper has a thickness and is a 3D shape, but since its thickness is so small, we often neglect it.\n\n    // Page 2\n\n::: column.fit\n\n    figure: x-img(src=\"images/ch1_42.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\")\n\n::: column.grow\n\nAs soon as humankind began constructing complex buildings, we needed solid geometry. In some Babylonian and Egyptian texts, you can see that they are concerned about the problems related to the sizes of the pyramids and other structures they have made.\n\nSince then, architects have been using 3D geometry to define the spatial form of a building.  Nowadays, the design of buildings is continually advancing by combining different 3D shapes and their properties.\n\n:::\n\n::: column(width=300)\n\n    // https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Barcelona_Cube-Ball-Pyramid_roof.jpg\n    figure: x-img(src=\"images/ch1_26.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\")\n\n{.caption} Barcelona Cube-Ball-Pyramid roof\n\n::: column(width=300)\n\n    // https://www.frazierdeeter.com/nationally-ranked-u-s-accounting-and-advisory-firm-expands-to-u-k/london-skyline/\n    figure: x-img(src=\"images/ch1_18.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"188.5\")\n\n{.caption} London Skyline\n\n:::"
