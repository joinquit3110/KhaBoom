Occasionally, soldiers were captured by\nthese rebels, and then had to spend months or even years in captivity.\n\nIt is easy to lose hope when you’ve been chained up in a hostage camp for such a long time, unable\nto see your family, and guarded by armed guerilla forces. However, in 2010, there was reason to\nbe hopeful: the army was approaching, and planning to rescue them shortly.\n\n::: column(width=260)\n\n    // https://depositphotos.com/97306690/stock-photo-jungle-in-colombian-green-mountains.html\n    x-img(src=\"images/rainforest.jpg\" width=260 height=320)\n\n:::\n\nUnfortunately, it seemed impossible to tell the prisoners that help was coming, without also\nalerting their captors – that is, until Colonel Jose Espejo came up with an ingenious idea. With\nhis team, he wrote a new pop song, embedded a secret message in the chorus, and then played it\nthousands of times over the radio.\n\nTo the rebels, it sounded just like meaningless music, but to the prisoners listening in, it was a\nmessage of hope. See if you can spot the message – it starts around 1:30.\n\n    figure: iframe(width=\"100%\" height=166 scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/184253099&color=%23295869&auto_play=false&hide_related=true&show_comments=false&show_user=false&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false&sharing=false&download=false&show_playcount=false\")"

First, notice that the codes on the left side are different from the codes on the right side. This allows the bar code to be read upside down or backwards.\n\n##### Barcodes in different countries\nThese barcodes with 12 digits are how they work in the US. In Europe, there are 13 digits. And other countries have different protocols for how barcodes. work.\n\n##### Digit Value\n\n- The first digit represents what type of object it is (0 - Standard; 2 - Weighted item like fruit; 3 - Pharmacy; 5 - Coupon)\n- Digits 2-6 (highlight) represent the *Manufacturer's Code*\n- The 7-11 (highlight) represent the *Product Code*\n- The final, 12th digit (highlight) is the __Error-Detection digit__, also called the __Modulo Check Character__\n\n##### Different between Left and Right\nEvery binary representation of digits on the left begins with a 0 and ends with a 1, and every digit on the right begins with a 1 and ends with a 0. This results in a pattern: there will always be a 10 (on the left side) or a 01 (on the right side) on the edge between digits.\n\n\n#### Error Checking.\nJust like our case with the satellite signals, there is a chance that the laser reading the barcode can make a mistake. Perhaps there is some dirt, or a scratch, or the laser reads it incorrectly. For that reason, barcodes have a special way of determining whether there's been a mistake.\n\nThe 12th digit is dependent on the first 11 digits, so that if any of the digits is wrong, we will know (most of the time). Can you guess how the 12th digit can indicate information about the first 11?\n\n{.fixme} The odd digit places are summed and multiplied by three. Then we calculate the sum of the even places, and sum these two values together. The __Modulo Check Character__ is 10 minus the ones digit of this number."

We don't know the message the satellite intended to send, and unlike with barcodes there is no way to find it, such as a cashier who can look at the number and type it into the computer.\n\nA mathematician named [Richard Hamming](bio:hamming) encountered a very similar problem not with data from satellites, but with mechanical computers.\n\n::: column.grow\n\nComputers used to be programmed by creating holes in special [punch cards](gloss:punch-card), which were then fed into the computer. These were time-consuming to program, and the calculations could take hours or even days to complete. In 1947, Hamming wrote a program to perform a long and complex series of calculations while he went home over the weekend. When he returned, he discovered that an error had occurred somewhere early in the calculation and his entire result was useless. He felt a need to invent a way to correct when an error had happened.\n\n::: column(width=280)\n\n    x-img(src=\"images/punch-card.png\" width=640 height=288 lightbox)\n    // https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue-punch-card-front-horiz.png\n\n{.caption} A blue IBM punched card.\n\n:::\n\n{.quote}If the computer can tell when an error has occurred, surely there is a way of telling where the error is so that the computer can correct the error itself. - Richard Hamming\n\nHow can we detect and correct an error in a messaage that is just a sequence of binary numbers? A [Hamming Code](gloss:hamming-code) can be used to do just this. The solution involves inserting new bits into the message that will tell us information about the values of those original bits. If we know the location of where an error occurred, then we know the original value of that bit because [[binary digits can only have two values|we can just look at the number under the barcode]]."

This shifting is the algorithm. The key is how many places it is shifted.\n\nTake a look at this message:\n\n“ymj hfpj nx ns ymj kwnilj. ny nx f hmthtqfyj hfpj bnym afsnqqf nhnsl fsi wfnsgtb xuwnspqjx.”\n\nWe know that each letter has been replaced with a new letter of the alphabet by shifting the whole alphabet over by a specific number of spaces.

      "content": "### Cryptography\n\n{.fixme} Cryptography (definition: cryptography is two words crypto - hidden, secret; and graphein - to write) is the art of hiding a message using an algorithm (a way of writing the cipher) and a key (the secret to locking and unlocking it). Many people can know an algorithm but only a few people should know the key, and the less people that know it, the more secure the message is.\n\nCryptography really is the art of hiding or obscuring a message. Early methods used steganography (definition: steganos - covered and graphein - to write), which is the art of simply hiding a message. It can be done in many ways, like using ink that can only be seen under certain conditions (like heat or acid), or hiding a message under something else (like wax, or even hair - though this one takes a long time).\n\nThis method physically hides the message but, if detected, the message can still be easily read.\n\nSo ciphers, like the Caesar, were designed to hide messages from being read by anyone who didn’t have the key. Sometimes these encrypted messages could be combined with stenography to make them even more secure.\n\n![](https://csegrecorder.com/columns/view/science-break-201303)\n\nIn previous modules (Link to module on Morse Code) you learned how letters and words could be written in different ways and encoded to symbols or sounds (like in Morse code). But this way of writing doesn’t hide the message, it just changes it into a different format (through an algorithm, but without a key); like how letters on a keyboard are converted to ASCII, then binary, and then back again to display on your phone or monitor. But if you know how to convert between the two languages you can read the message easily. Cryptography hides the message so that you need both an algorithm AND a key to read the message."

Only one of the tubes will be the right size to have the message line up properly and be read; all other messages will be gibberish.\n\nTo make a message even more difficult they could encrypt it and then wrap it around a tube. Meaning the person intercepting it would have to first find a tube of the correct size to line up the message before they could even begin to decipher it. And because the message would appear to be gibberish to start with, it would make it nearly impossible to find a tube the correct size (or would require a LOT of guesswork).\n\nInteractive Element: A text box students can write a message in, encrypt using the cipher wheel, and then an interactive ‘tube size selector’ that then wraps their message around the tube.

There would also be an option to print out the encrypted message and instructions on how to choose a tube size from items found around the home to make a physical scytale and then share it with friends and family.\n\n![](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Morse-Code)"

      "content": "### Frequency Analysis\n\nA Caesar, or substitution, cipher is one of the easiest ciphers to create, but it’s also one of the easiest to break (or crack). This is because all someone needs to do is figure out the shift being used and they can easily read the whole message. To break the encryption you’d just have to try shifting each letter in the ciphertext to see if it created a plaintext that made sense. If it does, you’ve got the key, if it doesn’t, then you try the next shift until you get it; and you’d only have to try Input Box (25) different times (at maximum).\n\n    // 25: Please check but I believe this is correct; if it was mapped A --> A it would be readable so there are only 25 choices for the shift really\n\nOf course this is looking at a basic Caesar cipher, which shifted the letters, but it kept them in order. But what would happen if we shuffled the letters and put them in a different order?\n\nLet’s start with the letter A, we could map it with itself, so A → A, but that would be rare and wouldn’t make much sense, but it’s still an option. Or we could map A → B, or A → C, or A → D and so on. This would give us Input Box (26) different possible options for A. We would then choose the next letter, let’s say B, assuming it wasn’t mapped to A, and do that one next. Well we know it can’t be mapped to A, as A is already mapped to another letter, but it could map to itself so that gives us Input Box (25) different options for B. We then pick our next letter and map it to other letter giving us Input Box (24) different options and so on…\n\nInteractive Element: Two rows of the alphabet and students can join a line from one letter to another, mapping them (like the image below). There will also be a counter that goes from 26 down to 1 for each mapping, showing the remaining choices for letters. This can then generate a substitution alphabet that students can use to encrypt and send a message with.\n\nThis would give us 26 * 25 * 24 * 23 * … * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 4.03 x 10^26 (Pop-up: multiplying a sequential chain of numbers like this can also be written as 26! where the ! means factorial. You can learn more about factorials here https://mathigon.org/world/Combinatorics ) different choices. Far too many choices to try a brute force attack (definition: trying one possibility after the other until you find one that works. This can be done systematically or at random) on to decipher. So instead we turn to frequency analysis to help us crack this code.\n\nTo start with frequency analysis involves looking at how many times a specific letter (or letters) appear in a block of text and comparing it to the most commonly used letters in that language). For example, in English, the most commonly used letter is the letter E. The least common letters are Z, X, Q and J.\n\nHere is what a general frequency analysis of the English language looks like:\n\nImage: frequency analysis chart There is a good generator here:\nhttps://www.braingle.com/brainteasers/codes/frequencyanalysis.php#form\n\nSo, for someone intercepting a secret message using a simple Caesar substitution cipher, all they would have to do is look for the letter that appears the most, assume it was an E, and then count how many letters it is from the letter E to determine the shift (or key). Let’s see how accurate it is. Using your mapping from above let’s encrypt a block of text and then run a frequency analysis on it to see how close it got.\n\nInteractive Element: A large block of text will be encoded using the the student’s mapping from above and then they could push a button that runs a frequency analysis on it and shows their mapping and the frequency analysis ‘guessing’. The block of text to be analyzed though should be pretty accurate to frequency analysis unsubstituted though to give the most accurate results.\n\nNow it’s your turn to try:\n\nhttps://asecuritysite.com/challenges/scramb\n\n    x-code-box\n      .input XXX\n      .output ???\n\nIf you picked up on the fact that the code above was generated using a simple Caesar cipher with a shift of Input (14) you may have been able to guess the letters more quickly. However, you can also use it on a more complicated cipher where the letters are not sequential such as:\n\nInteractive Element: The same as above but with a different encrypted text:\n\nNote: the above text decrypts as:\n\nSide note or pop-up: it is important to keep in mind that we are keeping punctuation and spaces in place for our encryptions, in most cases these are removed to make decrypting the text even harder.\n\nThere are also combinations of letters that are unique and appear more often together that can make our analysis work easier. In the English language this would be combinations like q and u, or the word “the” or the combination of letters like “th” “wh” and “ing”. All these patterns help to analyze text and determine what letters are being substituted.\n\nInteractive Element: An analysis of the above text that also shows the frequency of the common items (qu, the, th, wh, ing, an). Students could then click on a word or combination of letters in the text and see all the other instances highlighted and a counter of how many appear in the rest of the text."

      "content": "### The Vignere Cipher\n\n![](https://travelnoire.com/5-things-must-rome)\n\nIt’s now 1562 and you now find yourself in Rome once again trying to crack a code. This time it is a communication from one of the Pope’s security guards that reads:\n\n“EYDRICFILMRRBEGTYMESQNETVEMZKZXDHSFDLWLLKBRRRLXNRFAKFNEKTVCIUQEEDMYFUNPFOAZGOJLQDLFDGOTR”\n\nIt is imperative that the message be decrypted as you have discovered that the guard who sent it is a traitor and is involved in a plot to kidnap and ransom the Pope. But without proof, no one will believe you.\n\nYou initially try to decode the message using a simple Caesar cipher and try all 25 combinations, but nothing comes from it. You then try frequency analysis on the text, but it still comes out as gibberish, there are no patterns to be found. So you seek out Blaise de Vigenère, a French diplomat living in Rome as you have a sneaking suspicion you are dealing with a Vigenère cipher.\n\n![](http://www.musicologie.org/Biographies/v/vigenere_blaise_de.html)\n\nFirst credited to Giovan Battista Bellaso, an Italian cryptologist, the Vigenère cipher was named after Blaise de Vigenère, a French cryptographer and translator, who developed an autokey method of encryption about 20 years after Bellaso, based on his work.\n\nA Vigenère cipher starts with the concept of a transposition cipher (definition: a transposition cipher is one where the letters remain the same but their position changes). An example of this is a rail fence cipher where every other letter has been moved to the end of the sentence.\n\nInteractive Element: An animation of first the reverse of this process and then the forward method described here. Take the sentence “Cryptography is a fascinating field of mathematics. It allows people to converse with one another and not allow others to read the message.”. Remove all punctuation and spaces, take every other letter and move it to a row below the original sentence, then remove the spaces from both new lines and put the second line at the end of the first line. It should look like this by the end: cytgahiaacntnfedfahmtcIalwpoltcneswtoenteadoalwtesoedhmsaerporpysfsiaigilomteaistlosepeoovreihnaohrnntloohrtrateesg\n\nEach line was called a rail, and the number of rails could be 2 or more.\n\nInteractive Element: Allow students to write out a sentence, select the number of rails, and then it will reorganize the sentence as above.\n\nInteractive Element: Show the students the sentence “Miiirieoheeoiriaaaaahgnsnneatvtxbotatahsltfneetnfcsnmtfcstoatcetktcaotsgtdht” allow students to try different numbers of rails to decipher the text (the correct input is 3 rails). Input box for the answer: “Mathigon is an interactive textbook that teaches a lot of interesting facts and math facts.”\n\nThe Vigenère cipher takes this one step farther and uses a series of alphabets, each shifted by one more for each linke.\n\nImage: a picture of the alphabet written out 26 times, each line shifted by one, like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigenère_cipher#/media/File:Vigenère_square_shading.svg\n\nThen a keyword is picked:\n\nInteractive Element: Allow students to type in a 5 - 10 letter keyword of their choice. Show how this keyword would be used to encrypt a series of 15 A’s. This shows that each A is encrypted as a different letter until the keyword starts to repeat. This should be animated to show the path for encrypting each letter. It could be an automatic animation or students could click for each step.\n\nSo now that we have our keyword, and we can see how each letter is encrypted, we can use this to encrypt a sentence:\n\nInteractive Element: Allow students to type in a sentence of their choosing and, using their keyword, and the same animation as above show their sentence being encrypted. This site shows this process: https://studio.code.org/s/vigenere/stage/1/puzzle/1\n\nBy doing this the Vigenère cipher became an encryption method that was much more secure than a single Caesar cipher. It was essentially a series of Caesar ciphers strung together using a keyword, making it much stronger.\n\nBut don’t be fooled. Just because we are using a keyword to mix up the shifts it becomes much harder, but not impossible, to crack. For instance, since the person you are sending the message to needs to know the keyword, it could be intercepted and then the message could be easily read. Or someone could figure out what the keyword was based on what they knew about the person who sent the message (they could have used something easy to guess, like your favourite flower or a pet’s name).\n\nIn the case of your message from the Pope’s guard, this is exactly what happened. Using some investigative techniques you learned that the guard has a cat named Mr. Supreme Snuggles and tried that as the keyword.\n\nInteractive Element: Same as above but this time they copy in the sentence “EYDRICFILMRRBEGTYMESQNETVEMZKZXDHSFDLWLLKBRRRLXNRFAKFNEKTVCIUQEEDMYFUNPFOAZGOJLQDLFDGOTR” and the keyword mrsupremesnuggles. The message is shows should be “The Pope is planning on going from the Vatican to the Cathedral at nine oclock in the morning”. The students will have to put in their own spacing to fully read the message.\n\nLuckily you and Vigenère were able to figure out the keyword and saved the Pope. But what about if you didn’t have such information, or the sender had used a random phrase or group of letters. For many centuries the Vigenère cipher remained unbroken because people were unable to figure out how to find patterns that would help them decipher the text without knowing the keyword. And so it became the common method of sending messages for a very long time."

      "content": "In the 1830’s and 1840’s a new mode of communication was being used, called the telegraph. It was able to send messages, using Morse code, over large distances using cable lines. These lines ran between two points but could be easily spliced into and their messages intercepted. So operators used the Vigenère cipher to protect their messages.\n\n![](https://fineartamerica.com/featured/1-charles-babbage-1792-1871-granger.html)\n\nCharles Babbage (1791 - 1871) was an English polymath (definition: someone who knows a lot of different subjects and can use them to solve various complex problems) who became interested in finding a way to crack the Vigenère cipher. Building on the work of others who came before him Babbage was able to crack the cipher using the concept of frequency analysis and looking for repeating patterns in the messages in order to determine keyword lengths and eventually crack the code.\n\nIn order to break the Vigenère cipher, Babbage started by looking for patterns to try and find the length of the key. He spent what must have been enormous amounts of time pouring over encrypted blocks of text and studying it for repeating sets of letters that occurred at regular intervals in the text. He did this because he knew that once he knew the key length he could use frequency analysis on each part of the cipher to crack the overall code.\n\nInteractive Element (a slide show) -\nText to include “Say you have an encrypted block of text and you know that the key has a length of 6. This means that you know that the first letter of the ciphertext and the seventh letter of the ciphertext are encrypted using the same substitution alphabet; as you are now repeating the key and have returned to the starting letter.” The animation shows how the 1st and 7th letters are encrypted using the same row of the Vignere cipher (this can be pulled from the previous animation showing how the Vignere cipher works).\nThe next slide would be an animation showing the following text being split into its parts (every 7th letter, starting from the 8th, being grouped together). Text: “This means we can then rewrite the original text grouping all the 1st, 7th, 14th, 21st, etc letters together.”\nThe next slide would be a frequency analysis chart being generated for each section of the text. Text: We can then perform a frequency analysis on each part of the text to determine each letter of the key\nText: Finally we have a key and we can use it to decrypt the entire text (or put it back together from its parts)\n\nBut what happens if you don’t know the length of the key, which in most cases you wouldn’t? Well, in cryptography, patterns are the downfall of a cipher and Babbage knew this. By looking for repetitions of patterns in the ciphertext he was able to break them down to determine the length of the key. He did this by looking for repeated sequences in the text, how long the repeated sequences were, and how many spaces were between the sequences.\n\nLet’s say we had a block of text we knew was encrypted with a Vigenère cipher and we found the following patterns in it that kept repeating at regular intervals: LSB, PMBJT, WJRFL, JCAT. We would then create a chart like the one below and fill in factors of each spacing.\n\nInteractive Element: Students would check off the factor boxes for each pattern (putting in the X’s below). Note: the rest of the chart would be filled in for them.\n\nWe can now see that the common factor between the spacings of repeated patterns is 7; meaning our key is 7 characters long. We now have a pattern to work with and a known key length. Now it just becomes a matter of breaking up the text and using frequency analysis, along with a lot of guesswork, to crack the code.\n\nSadly, Babbage never published his work and the credit for cracking the Vigenère cipher eventually went to Fredrich Wilhelm Kasiski who broke the cipher independently of Babbage’s work and published it in 1863."

      "content": "### The One Time Pad\n\n![](https://www.nutsvolts.com/magazine/article/may2015_Koebel)\n\nWe now find ourselves in 1894 and in the time of a wonderful new invention: the radio. This wondrous device has made communication much easier and faster as a wire between places is no longer needed; merely a transmitter and a receiver aimed at each other. However, they are also much less secure. To intercept a message you no longer have to splice into a telegraph wire, you just have to aim your own receiver at a transmitter to intercept all the messages you want (including encrypted ones).\n\nDuring WWI this caused an issue as there were no new unbreakable ciphers being created, they were just using variations on older ciphers (which already had methods to break them). In addition to methods to break these codes, due to the ease of using radio waves, more messages were being sent and intercepted so there was more text to work with (remember, more text = easier to find patterns = easier to decrypt). Another issue with radio waves is the ability to triangulate where the signal is coming from.\n\nInteractive Element: a picture of two receivers (like the two satellites in the image shown) that students can move around to point in different directions. When they are pointed at a certain (hidden) point they will beep - they beep slowly when pointed away from the hidden point and more quickly as they get closer and a sustained tone when pointed directly at the spot. Once both receivers are pointing at the same point it will appear. If sound is not an option then a dotted line can be used (getting darker as it gets closer to the point) when only one transceiver is point at the right spot and then a dot appears when they are both pointed at the same spot.\n\nSo not only could you intercept the messages and decode them you could also figure out where they were being sent from. This was especially handy if you were decrypting plans for an attack and now you knew not only what their plans were, but where they were hiding too!\n\nAs we know the longer a key is, the harder it is to break. But with a bit of skill and time, even long keys can be broken. Also, keywords would have to be shared among radio operators so if one was lost or captured then all their messages could be read.\n\n![](https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/otp/index.htm)\n\nThis led to the Invention of the one-time pad. This was a large book that contained strings of random letters. Each time a message was sent it was encoded using a page of the book. It was then decoded using the same page on the other end. Then both parties would throw out that page of the book, so that code would never be used again.\n\nThis meant there was no repetition for code breakers to use. The random strings meant no easily guessable words, and no easily guessable phrases (Pop-up: sometimes codebreakers would get to know the operators and they would use words like their mother’s name or favourite ice cream flavour). This made one-time pads very secure. But they were also highly impractical as operators needed large code books distributed to them on a regular basis and, if one was captured, they would all become compromised and useless.\n\nImportant note: The weakest link in cryptography is often humans and the fact that they simplify things to make them easier to remember, but also easier to guess. The worst thing for a secure encryption is a repeating pattern."

It was also going to spawn a new and highly effective way to encrypt messages. The Enigma machine!\n\n![](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rare-alan-turing-manuscript-enigma-machine-auction-bonhams/)\n\nIn 1918 Arthur Scherbius and Richard Ritter formed the Scherbius and Ritter company. They made many things but one of the most famous of these is the Enigma machine.\n\nOriginally made of 3 parts (a 4th was added later) and connected by wires the Enigma combined many different elements of cryptography into a single machine.\n\nThe three parts are 1) a keyboard for entering in plain or cipher text, 2) a set of rotors for encrypting / decrypting the text, and 3) a light board for displaying the final text. Later on plugboards and a reflector were added. The machine itself looks like a typewriter. When you enter a letter by pressing a key the encoded letter lights up. Someone writes down these encoded letters and then uses this to send the message (usually through radio message) to the recipient. When the message is received on the other end the operator types in the letters and records the letters that light up, providing them with the unencoded message.\n\nInteractive Element: an exploded image of the Enigma machine where each part is highlighted / brought out when a student clicks on the part name. Kind of like these:\n\n![](https://hackaday.com/2017/08/22/the-enigma-enigma-how-the-enigma-machine-worked/)\n\n![]( https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-an-enigma-machine-rotor-on-display-showing-the-internal-wiring-in-41587437.html)\n\nIn its simplest form an Enigma machine is simply a mechanical Vigenère cipher with a 26 letter keyword. An operator types a letter, an electrical signal then gets sent through a wire to encrypt that letter to a new letter and then the new letter lights up on the board. This new letter is then written down, the rotor moves forward one place, and the next letter is typed and it’s encrypted version lights up. This continues until the rotor has gone around all 26 spots and then returns to its initial position.\n\nInteractive Element: this will be a slide show showing the following steps:\nThe first part is the first rotor of the machine, which operates similar to a basic Caesar cipher. The students type in a letter and it shows the encrypted letter lighting up - start with a shift of 3 - and then each time it moves forward by one letter. You can use the paper template (see comment) to get an idea of what the picture would look like but it should show the path from the letter typed to the encrypted letter with each letter the student types. Students should be encouraged to type the same letter multiple times and see how each time it is encoded differently. Text to be included:\nWith only one rotor this is no better than a simple cipher wheel and only gives 25 different starting points (26 if it maps to itself, which wouldn’t make much sense), which could easily be cracked.\nA second wheel is added, it only turns once more than 26 letters have been typed so there must be a minimum requirement on the input box to type more than 26 letters - or have a bunch of letters already pre-programmed into the box. The same highlighting of the path should be shown. Text to be included:\nSo they added a second wheel, one that only turned once the first had gone all the way around (after 26 letters had been typed). By adding this second rotor there were now Input box (26 * 26 = 676) different combinations. This was better but a team of cryptographers, especially ones who had their own Enigma machines, would be able to determine the correct orientation in fairly short order. And so a third rotor was added.\nA third rotor added, same idea as above showing the path being followed by the letters being encrypted. A large block of text should be included though to show the first, second and third rotors moving (as the third only moves once the second has rotated 26 times). Text to be included:\nThis gave Input box 26*26*26 = 17,576 possible combinations. And, while much better, a dedicated team with access to a machine, could still potentially crack this. And so eventually they added a plugboard that switched 6 letters with each other.\nInteractive Element: an image of a plug board that students can drag the cord from one letter to another to switch them before being fed into the Enigma machine. There should be 3 such cords.\nThe plugboard added a random element to the encryption and gave another 100,391,791,500 additional combinations. They also decided to make the rotors moveable (so they could be put in different configurations), giving another 6 options.\nInteractive Element: an animation showing each piece of the Enigma machine being put in with the number of combinations it adds and a running total of combinations. Text to be included:\nIn total, a fully equipped Enigma machine had over 10 x 10^16 possible configurations making it impossible to crack through brute force attempts.\n\nBecause of the way the Enigma machine worked you couldn’t do frequency analysis on the ciphertext. Some letters were switched using the plugboards, and each letter was encrypted different from the one before it. Even in the simplest form of Enigma, with just three rotors, you would have to type 17,576 letters before repeating the encryption pattern and this would have to be done many, many times for a discernable pattern to emerge.(Pop-up” For comparison a Twitter post is a maximum of 280 characters so you’d need to post about Input box (62 or 63) tweets before your encryption pattern would start to repeat.)\n\n![](http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmatech.htm#reflector)\n\nOne of the neatest elements of the Enigma machine was the inclusion of a reflector panel at the back of the machine. This panel would serve to link two encrypted letters together so that the machine could be used to both encrypt and decrypt text with the same rotor settings. On the rotors letters could be linked to new letters: for example P → H, H → C, C → B. But the reflector was responsible for linking the letters as pairs: so P → B and B → P. Once a rotor setting was set the reflector would make sure that the wiring for the forward and backwards processes were also linked together.\n\nWhile this made it easy to use the same machine, with the same settings, to encrypt and decrypt messages, it also meant that a letter could never be linked to itself; and this made the job of code crackers much easier later on.\n\nInteractive Element: the second portion the paper simulator from above showing the reflector panel being added and the letter being encrypted being traced through the encryption, bouncing off the reflector and travelling back to light up the encrypted letter and then the reverse process as well.\n\nNow that we know how Enigma works, let’s try it out ourselves:\n\nInteractive Element: an emulator similar to this where students can press a keyboard, switch a plugboard, and see the new letter light up https://www.101computing.net/enigma-machine-emulator/"

      "content": "Because of all these features, the German military believed that the Enigma code was impossible to crack – but they were wrong. Breaking Enigma included some of the most groundbreaking achievements during the second world war, involving some of the greatest mathematicians in history, the invention of computers, and a little bit (or a lot) of luck.\nBreaking it also saved thousands of lives by ending the war a few years earlier.\n\nIt all started in 1938 when rumblings had started that Germany was going to invade Poland and knowledge of a new, unbreakable, code machine to be used by them had started to spread.\n\n![](http://dailyinfographics.eu/world-war-ii-on-old-maps/)\n\n![](https://www.polishgreatness.com/enigma.html)\n\nDesperate to help however he could, Mariam Rejewski, a Polish cryptographer, was one of the first people to attempt to break Enigma. Just prior to WWII Rejewski received the blueprint for making a military style Enigma machine from a disgruntled German named Hans-Thilo Schmidt. But having the machine (the algorithm) wasn’t enough, he needed the key. With over 10x10^16 possible keys it was a daunting task but Rejewski realized if he could somehow separate the plugboards from the rotors he could dramatically decrease the potential number of keys. In fact, if he could separate out the plugboards he would only have 6 * 26 * 26 * 26 =  Input box 105,456 potential settings to work with (note: there were an extra 6 settings in the Enigma Rejewksi was working with because in his version of the Enigma you could take the three rotors out and change their physical positions in the machine, giving another 6 configurations).\n\nInteractive Element: a table like this that students can fill out or physical/clickable/draggable rotors that students can move around and ‘plug into’ an Enigma machine and a counter that keeps track of the different combinations.\n\nPossible Rotor Settings\n123\n132\n231\n321\n213\n231\n\nThis was not a small number but, with enough effort, he realized he could do it, he just needed to get rid of those plugboards somehow. So set to work on the issue and soon he realized that, because the plugboards were fixed in their substitutions they had an effect on the messages themselves, but they didn’t have an effect on how those letters were linked to each other when encrypted. A “P” switched with a “B” would switch those letters in the final message but it wouldn’t change what “P” and “B” were encrypted as when they went through the Enigma rotors.\n\nImage: an plugboard showing P switched with B, J switched with T, and W with R\n\nSuccess! This served to simplify the problem greatly, but he was still stuck on how to break the rest of the encryption.\n\nRejewski’s biggest breakthrough came from the way messages were sent by the German’s. Realizing that repetition in encryption was bad, and could lead to messages being cracked, the German’s used a combination of day codes and message codes, and this became their downfall.\n\nDay codes were the rotor and plugboard settings to be used each day by operators. These would be sent in codebooks to the operators every few weeks. However, sending millions of messages using the same key would create a lot of repetition, so instead of coding each message with the same key, the operators would use the day codes to send a special message key for each message they sent.\n\nThis three letter key (one for each rotor setting) would be encrypted at the start of the message using the day key, then the rotors would be set to the message key and the rest of the message would be written.\n\nLet’s assume an Enigma machine’s day key for the rotors was G B K, choose your own three letter message key, and send it through the machine, write it down somewhere safe and we’ll come back to it shortly.\n\nInteractive Element: using the tracing element from before students can set the rotors to be G B K and then enter a three letter code and see how it comes out. Need to make sure it is just the three rotors, not the plugboards.\n\nBy having different day and message codes it worked well to keep the day code from being overused, however the Germans made one fatal flaw with this method. They insisted that, in order to ensure there were no issues with receiving the message code (due to operator error or poor reception when sending/receiving the message), the code was sent twice. So if the operator chose a message key of J A T then the operator would first set their rotors to the day key, and then start the message by writing J A T J A T. They would then reset the rotors to the settings J A T and type the rest of their message.\n\nImage/Animation: three rotors set to a code of GBK, then a message being encrypted and the rotors being reset to JAT and the rest of the message being written.\n\nGo back to your message key (the one you wrote down) and now encrypt it twice - noting that the six letter string you get out will have six different letters (even though it’s a repeating pattern). We are now going to use that repeating pattern to crack Enigma.\n\nThe repetition of the message key using the day key allowed Rejewksi to study links and patterns in the messages, because all of these initial message keys were sent using the same day key.\n\nHe knew that the first 6 letters of any message were the message key and that the first and fourth, second and fifth, and third and sixth letters of these keys were the same letters. By intercepting multiple messages in a day he was able to build an alphabet matching the pairs of letters up and then was able to trace the number of links between letters.\n\nTo keep it simple, and make sure that we have all 26 letters properly included and mapped, we’ll assume that the message keys are each letter of the alphabet repeated: AAA, BBB, CCC, etc. In reality, operators used many different combinations of three letters for their message keys (and some lazy operators even used AAA, BBB, CCC, which made it easier for code breakers like Rejewski when they did).\n\nInteractive Element: an illustration / animation showing the following - I think it should first be an animation showing the data and highlighting the chains and links. This could be done with the first and fourth letters and then the students could fill in the patterns for the second and fifth and third and sixth to ‘break the day code’. I’ve provided an explanation below of how it works but I would be happy to speak with the person creating it to explain in detail how it works. Or I could make a little video explaining it.\n\nSo this method seemed pretty effective for cracking most messages, however it wasn’t perfect. For instance, what would happen if two or more day keys had a similar chain and link pattern? Well, because of the way the Enigma was created, it would be almost impossible for two day codes to have the exact same chain and link profile. And even if they did, it would simply be a matter of testing the duplicated keys until a message that made sense was found. Or what if the letters chosen for the day key or message key were also the letters that had been swapped in the plugboards? In this case Rejewksi might have had to assume he had most of the key correct and then test out the various plugboard settings until he found a key that unlocked the rest of the message.\n\nWhile Rejewksi’s method had some flaws it was still a revolution and a breakthrough for cracking the Enigma and helped with future efforts. However, Rejewksi’s exact method was a short lived victory as soon after creating his codebooks 2 extra, interchangeable cylinders were added to the machine which gave an extra 60 arrangements of the rotors and increased the number of possible rotor configurations to 1,054,560. To add to this they also increased the number of plugboards from 6 to 10, giving 20 possible letter swaps for a total of 1.59x10^20 possible keys. Rejewkski would have needed 10 times more bombes to create a new code book and they were too expensive for the Polish intelligence. Enigma now, once again, seemed unbreakable. Add to this the fact that Germany was about to invade Poland and so Rejewski, and Polish intelligence, gave all his work (including the blueprints for making an Enigma machine, how to set up a bombe, and his methods) to the French and British intelligence."

One person needs to make a message secret, and so they create a way to encrypt it. Then another person wants to read it so they find a way to break it. So then a new method needs to be created to encrypt messages again, and a new method to break it, and so on, and so on… And methods are always building upon themselves, in fact you can see how the simple Caesar cipher can be found in every other process discussed here, including the ‘uncrackable’ Enigma.\n\nWe also need various methods of cryptography for different purposes. For example, while highly secure, one-time pads were awkward to use and not practical for day to day use and are now only used in a few situations. Enigma was highly secure but required large, bulky machines and operators, making them impractical in many situations. Yet, Caesar and Vigenère ciphers could be done with a piece of paper and knowledge of the shift or keyword, but could be easily broken. Different methods of cryptography therefore are used for different purposes and where they make the most sense.\n\nAlso, because of the inherent secrecy of cryptography, many methods of decryption, including the people who work on it, remain hidden and secret for many years after their work is done. For example, those who worked at Bletchley Park, including Alan Turing, returned home to be seen by friends and family as not contributing to the war efforts; and they were forbidden to speak of their work. Even the accomplishments of Flowers and his Colossus machine weren’t revealed to the public until decades later. In the case of Turing, he passed away before ever receiving recognition for his contributions.\n\nIt is believed that, even today, there are many government and private efforts to both protect and decrypt our data. But the people working on these efforts remain hidden and secret; just like the codes they are attempting to make and break!"

      "content": "RSA\n\nYou want to send a message to your friend, but your friend lives on the other side of the world. There are many ways you can send this message including: sending a letter through the mail, phoning them, or sending them an electronic message (like an email, text message, or message through social media or an app). If you want the message to not be read by others then you need to find some way to encrypt it. As we have seen in previous chapters cryptography requires two parts: an algorithm (a way to encrypt the information) and a key (a specific piece of information required to ‘crack the code’). In earlier times the key would often be written down and distributed to those exchanging messages. This could be done through code books, or by simply telling the other person the key directly. Cryptographers who intercepted these encrypted messages would look for ways to break them or, if they were lucky enough, would find these codebooks or intercept the keys in some way (a spy or someone who wasn’t careful keeping the key a secret - like writing it down) and then they would have access to all the hidden messages.\n\nWhile the modern internet, and modern computers, have made communication across the world much faster and easier it has also presented new ways for information to be intercepted. Let’s say the message you want to send to your friend is supposed to be secret, but it gets intercepted along the way. If you were to use one of the methods of cryptography described earlier a modern computer could easily crack it by using the tricks and methods developed by people like Babbage, Rejewski and Turing; things like frequency analysis and investigating patterns within the encrypted code. It could also use a brute force attack with thousands of possibilities a second; much faster than cracking it by hand.\n\nSo you need to share a key first, but how can you do this safely? Let’s say you’re sending an email to your friend, how could you send the key?\n\nInteractive Element: a drop down list of different options they could pick to send the key separate from the message and each selection would have a pop-up of the difficulties that method presents:\n\n\nMethod\nIssue\nSend another email\nIf the email address has already been ‘hacked’ then the interceptor will have both key and message.\nPhone them\nThey have to remember the key exactly; you might be more tempted to pick a really simple/easy to remember key for them; the phone could also be hacked; they could choose to write the key down on a piece of paper that could be found or on a file on their computer that could be seen if the computer and not the email was hacked\nTell it to them in person\nRequires you both to be in the same place; hey have to remember the key exactly; you might be more tempted to pick a really simple/easy to remember key for them; they could choose to write the key down on a piece of paper that could be found or lost, or they could write it as a file on their computer that could be seen if the computer and not the email was hacked\nSend it to them over another form of communication (text message, social media, an app)\nMessage could be intercepted by the phone company or by the company that owns the social media or app; if their computer is compromised the hacker might be able to see the key regardless of the way it is sent.\n\nAs you can see there are many ways that the key could be intercepted. So why not create a method to send a key publicly where it doesn’t matter if someone else gets it? That’s what RSA is.\n\n\nFrom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Security\n\nRSA is named after the co-founders of RSA Security: Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adelman, and they named the encryption method the same. It uses a series of public (Definition: not secret, can be intercepted, and read by a third party freely) and private (Definition: only known by the recipient and kept secure on their system) keys, along with modular arithmetic, to encrypt messages being sent electronically and ensure that, even if they are intercepted, they can’t be cracked."

      "content": "Prime Numbers\n\nTo explain how RSA encryption works we have to start with prime numbers (link to Prime Numbers module in Mathigon) and factors.\n\nWhat are all the factors of 150? Input 1, 150, 2, 75, 3, 50, 5, 30, 6, 25, 15, 10\n\nNow how about 151? Input 1, 151\n\n151 is a prime number so there are only two factors. If you knew that 151 was a prime, getting the factors would be quite easy, but it becomes more work if you don’t know it’s a prime, as you have to test all the numbers in between 1 and 151 to see if 151 is evenly divisible by any of them.\n\nNow there are some tricks that can simplify this such as any even number is divisible by 2, a number ending in 5 or 0 is divisible by 5, but for larger numbers it can be quite tricky. Imagine finding all the factors of 125728394792, it would take a while, even with the help of a computer.\n\nLet’s go the other way now. What is 547 x 251? Input 137,297\n\nPretty easy to figure out (especially if you have a calculator or computer on hand).

Now with the help of a computer you could determine this answer pretty quickly, it would be very difficult to figure it out by hand (but it could be done, especially if you knew it was the product of two prime numbers).\n\nHowever, what if the prime number was longer, MUCH longer. In fact, in 2048-bit RSA encryption the number is 617 digits long.  A number this long, with only 4 factors, would take a classic, modern computer about 300 trillion years to crack. So this is what RSA makes use of."

    {
      "content": "So how does knowing the factors of a number help secure information? It has to do with private and public keys. A public key is something that can be shared freely between people and it doesn’t matter if someone else intercepts it. Without the private key, which is stored only by the sender or the recipient (not both - they each have their own) then intercepting the message and the public key is not enough to decrypt the message. But when you pair the public and private key together, the message unlocks and can be read only by the intended recipients.\n\nGenerating the Keys\n\nIn order to generate our keys we need to pick two prime numbers that are big enough and far enough apart that they will work. The smaller the numbers and the closer together they are the Input (selection box “easier” or “harder” choices, correct answer is “easier”) they are to guess.\n\nInteractive Element: this will be a multi-step process (it could be set up as a step by step slideshow with text and inputs)\nStep 1: Text: “first we choose two prime numbers Pop-up/side note: the actual numbers chosen for RSA are normally very large and a primality test (like the Rabin-Miller Primality Test) is used to ensure that they are actually prime numbers.” students will then choose two prime numbers (there needs to be instructions and a check that the primes are at least over 100 and they have to be primes). The two primes should be labelled “p” and “q”\nStep 2: Text: “next multiply your two primes together” students will then multiple the two numbers together to give “n”\nStep 3: Text: “now we need to find a number that will form an upper limit for our next step. This is done using Carmichael’s totient function: \\lambda(n) = lcm(p-1, q-1), where lcm is the least or lowest common multiple (you can learn more about lcm here). However, because lcm requires finding prime factors and we are dealing with large numbers here’s a calculator to help you” Students will input their p-1 and q-1 numbers and then we will provide a calculator to determine the lcm for those numbers and show them their \\lambda value (like this: https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/lcm.php)\nStep 4: Text: “we now use this \\lambda(n) value to find a value we can use to make up our public key called e” students will then be asked to pick a prime number (e) between 1 and \\lambda(n). This could be an auto-generated list of prime numbers between 1 and their \\lambda(n) and they click on what number they want to use.\nStep 5: Text: “we now have p, q, n, and e to work with, where our public key is a combination of e and n” These numbers should all be filled in, perhaps a labelled box with their various values.\nStep 6: Text: “so now it’s time to encrypt. Let’s start with a very simple message, a number (we’ll talk about text later), and call it m.” students pick a number between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and it gets labelled as m.\nStep 7: Text: “now we are going to use this equation to encrypt our message c = m^e mod n. Pop-up: this pop-up links to the below section on modular arithmetic” students will fill in the equation with the various parts to solve for c, this should be a calculator that shows the various steps (the m^e calculation and then finding out the mod n part).\nStep 8: Text: “so we now have our plaintext (the student’s m value) as a ciphertext (the student’s c value) that gets sent to the receiver.”\n\nPop-up on Modular Arithmetic (see above):\nIn order to understand this method of encryption we have to understand the concept of modular arithmetic. In its most basic form modular arithmetic is like reading a clock where the ‘n’ in mod n determines how many ‘hours’ there are. Every time the clock reaches back to where it starts we restart our numbering (like when we go from 12:59 to 1:00 on a regular clock, we don’t go to 13 because there are only 12 numbers on the face).\n\nEach time we go around the clock we return to our starting number. So if we were going on a trip and we left at midnight and it was going to take 18 hours to get to our destination, what time would it be when we get there? Input: 6:00 (this should be a drop down with options to avoid am, pm, or 24 hour time).\n\nSo you see, we went around the clock 18 ‘hours’ but ended up at the number 6. This is the basis of modular arithmetic. It’s how many times the number we are looking for goes into the mod evenly, and the remainder becomes the value we are looking for.\n\nLet’s try an example: say we are looking at the number 13 in mod 5. Important note: unlike the clock above, we always start modular calculations with a 0 so the numbers go from 0 to n-1 (more on this in a minute). So to find 13 mod 5 we can simply count, starting at 0, 13 places, and then record where we end up Input 3.\n\n\nSo how do we do this for bigger numbers (because who wants to count something like 447 mod 5) and why do we start at 0? This is because modular arithmetic is based on integer division and remainders. So to calculate 447 mod 5 we divide 447 by 5 and then we look at the remainder Input 2. The reason we start at 0: because a number like 550 mod 5 would have a remainder of Input 0 not of 5.\n\nHow to calculate mods: the best way to do this is to practice long division and find the integer remainder of the number.\n\nInteractive Element: have students calculate 134 mod 8. This should be set up as a long division question where they have to put an input at each step and they find the remainder to be 6. It should look something like this (where the blue boxes are input boxes and the text in them is the correct solution):\n\nSo 134 mod 8 = Input 6\n\nFor very large numbers however, we often use a mod calculator.\n\nSo now we have an encrypted message that we can send to a receiver. But we need to make sure they can read it. This is where the private key comes in.\n\nA private key must work with the public key so we use the same e and n values. Neither the e or n value is particularly useful on its own, and remember, the n value is actually the product of two prime numbers, which we saw before were very difficult (if not impossible) to guess for large, far apart numbers.\n\nSo we send e and n out in the open and they are received by our intended recipient, and if someone else gets them in the middle it’s not going to be of much use.\n\nTo create the private key (called d) we use this formula:\n\nd = 1/e mod \\lambda(n)\n\nNow it’s important to note that 1/e is not 1 divided by e but is instead the modular inverse of e. To solve for this we are going to use a calculator as finding this by hand involves the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is beyond the scope of this lesson but more can be found here https://www.extendedeuclideanalgorithm.com/index.php\n\nSo let’s take our e value Interactive Element: the e value from before and an inverse modular calculator like the one here (https://planetcalc.com/3311/) to give an answer.\n\nWe then use that information and the value of n Interactive Element: the value of n from above\n\nTo calculate d Interactive Element: the value of d\n\nVoila! Our private key (d).\n\nNow we can use our value of (d), the product of two primes (n), and our public key (c), to decrypt the message (m) as:\n\nm = c^d mod n\n\nInteractive Element: students will input their various values and the value of m will be calculated. It should be the same m value as what they chose in the previous step."

They would then see their word appear as a series of numbers.\n\nAs you can see your word (their word from above) has been re-written as (the ASCII text from above) and we know how to encrypt a series of numbers using RSA. The computer can then transform this into binary (Link to Mathigon section on Binary) and send the message through the internet; safe in the knowledge it is secure and unreadable by anyone without a corresponding key."

      "content": "From: (not sure where this image is from but it’s just to show an interceptor of the messages)\n\nThe public and private key exchange used in RSA allows for users to keep parts of the key hidden and away from potential interceptors but to share a public aspect that is useless without the other part. This is what makes it possible to send encrypted, secret, message through insecure means without a worry that someone will be able to decrypt it.\n\nBy using the power of prime numbers, and the near un-guessability of the factors of a product of two large primes, we are able to keep messages safe as they travel through the internet."

      "content": "Cracking RSA (P vs NP and Quantum Computers)\n\nWhenever anyone comes up with a new way to secure and encrypt data following right behind them are the codebreakers, and RSA is no different. Currently there are two considerations for the long term usability of RSA encryption.\n\nThe first is linked to something called the P vs NP problem, which is one of the 7 Millenium Prize Problems (valued at $1 million to whoever can solve it) Link: http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems. The question essentially sets P as ‘easy to find’ and NP as ‘easy to check’. It then seeks to ask if we can easily/quickly check a solution then can it also be solved quickly. In RSA, we can quickly check if a given solution is correct (we just see if the value for m we get out is correct), so if we are able to quickly solve it as well, then it would be easily cracked by modern computers.\n\nThe second deals with the development of newer and faster computers. As mentioned previously, a ‘classic’ modern computer would take about 300 trillion years to crack a 2048 bit RSA encryption; but, it did crack a 768 bit RSA in about 2 years. Still a long time, but it does mean it’s doable.\n\nFrom: https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612844/what-is-quantum-computing/\n\nEnter the quantum computer. A quantum computer works on the principles of superposition (Definition: we can add quantum states together and get a new quantum state) and entanglement (Definition: that two particles or groups are connected to each other in a way that you can’t change one without affecting the other). Quantum mechanics, and quantum computing, is a whole new way of looking at how we process information. In terms of RSA, unlike a modern ‘classic’ computer that would test every prime number until it found one that was a factor of n, a quantum computer could test all the primes nearly simultaneously and determine n in a matter of seconds (not years).\n\nBut, while many people are currently working on problems like P vs NP and quantum computers we are still a long way off. The most modern version of a quantum we have currently can only handle a 2-digit factor (remember, RSA 2048 uses 617 digits) so the solution is still a long way off. But, like any form of encryption, people will keep trying to break it. Luckily we can also use these new technologies to create newer, and more secure, methods of keeping our data safe as well!"
