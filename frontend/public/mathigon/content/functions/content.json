Notice how the mapping diagram relates to the graph. The axes in the coordinate plane below take names other than x and y, the variables we‚Äôve seen before. This graph, for instance, includes a name- and a house-axis.\n\nTODO Interactive here\n\nUsing coordinate systems, it is also very easy to check whether a relation is many-to-many, or one-to-many. The many-to-one and many-to-many graphs have [[at least one | no]] points that share an x-value. The one-to-one and one-to-many graphs have [[no | at least one]] points that share an x-value.\n\nGo through the coordinate system from left to right, and check if there are any two points connected by a vertical line. This means that they share the same x-value, so the relation is not many-to-one. This is called the vertical line test. The graphs that share an x-value seem like they could have a vertical line that connects [[two or more | none]] of their points.\n\nTODO Interactive here"

Simultaneously, a distance-time graph populates in a card to the right of the animation.\n\n[vault mock-up](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/td3fynck7q)\n\nThere are several things going on here. Move the video back and forth to see how the graph lines up with the motion.\n\nFirst, we need to understand is what the axes represent. The x-axis in this graph is the horizontal distance Ri travels throughout his vault. It is measured in centimeters. The y-axis is the vertical distance in centimeters Ri travels. This gives us information about Ri‚Äôs position much like chess pieces on a board.\n\nThe graph does not include any information about time. For example, we cannot tell _when_ Ri landed on the pit. Some of the graphs of later events will include time along the horizontal axis.\n\nOn this graph, we see the vault is at ([[3565+-5]], [[135+-5]])), which means Ri ran about 3.5 meters in his approach. The starting point on the runway is at the [__origin__](gloss:coordinate-system-origin). Ri lands at (3910, 30), which means the pit is about [[30]] centimeters tall."

We can use information from the graph to write the function describing Cielo‚Äôs swim. Let‚Äôs call the function f(t).\n\nRemember the general form for [__linear function__](gloss:linear-function) like this is y=mx+c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept. We replace y with the name of the function, and we replace x with the input variable for this function.\n\n{.text-center} `y=mx+c`\n`=> f(t)=m[[t]]+c`\n\nThis means we need to find [[slope {.fixme} also accept \"m\"]] and [[y-intercept {.fixme} also accept \"c\"]] from the graph.\n\nNotice the [horizontal-axis](target:1_xAxis), in this graph shows [[time]] in seconds. The [vertical-axis](target:1_yAxis) is the distance from the starting block to the opposite end of the pool measured in [[meters]].

The horizontal distances measure [[1]] second. Cielo‚Äôs speed [[stayed constant | increased | decreased]] for this race, which is a key feature of linear functions.\n\nRecall that the [__slope__](gloss:line-slope) is the vertical change divided by the horizontal change (rise over run).

Immediately, we notice the shape of this graph is different from the swimming graphs above. This graph has [[2]] turning points compared to the linear functions [[0]] turning points.\n\nGraphs with this shape are called cubic functions. We can get important information from the graph even without knowing the function equation. Match the given statements to the graph.\n\n:::\n\n    // NOTES\n    // Students cards for all of the items below, and then drag them onto the corresponding point along the graph.

Is that correct? If so, I wonder how it would go if the order is flipped - students choose any item from the table above and then when they drag it into the correct spot, some narrative comes up explaining the math of that point. I'm only suggesting this because as I read the table without any of the text below, I found myself moving all the \"cards\" into the correct spot on the graph and enjoyed that. Maybe the scaffolding is needed and important tot the math here. Just sharing my 1st experience of reading the table.\nRecall the y-intercept is where x=[[0]]. In function notation, this looks like d([[0]])=10. The pattern of d(0)=y-intercept is true for any function.\n    // That's an interesting thought. +philipp@mathigon.org can text oder be dependent on how the student uses the interactive? In this case, what order they choose to place the cards on the graph?\n\nSimilarly, the x-intercepts are were [[d(x) | x]]=0. This graph has [[2]] x-intercepts. They represent the surface of the water in the pool."

She reaches her maximum height when she is [[0.3+-0.1]] meters from the board. In function notation, this looks like [[d(0.3)=10.9 | d(10.9=0.3]].\n\nThe minimum is Ren‚Äôs lowest height. In this graph her lowest point is underwater. Because the x-axis represents the surface of the water, the minimum d(x) is [[negative | positive | zero]]. She turns around at [[-1.6 +-0.1]] meters underwater and [[2.6 +-0.1]] meters from the diving platform."

      "content": "// NOTES\n    // +philipp@mathigon.org I pulled the intervals of increase from the cards. Do we want to pull it from the discussion, too? It gives a few more opportunities to use intevals.\n\nIntuitively, we understand that the graph is increasing when Ren‚Äôs body is moving [[up | down]]. The notation for increasing is different from tuning points and intercepts. Since the graph increases for more than one point, we represent the section of the graph using an [__interval__](gloss:interval). The interval communicates the [[x | d(x)]] values corresponding to Ren‚Äôs increasing height. Note that there are many different ways to write intervals, we use inequalities in this chapter.\n\nRen moves up during the intervals:\n\n    // NOTES\n    // Multiple selector (shuffle order)\n\n0<x<0.335\t\t0.335<x<2.556\t\t2.556<x<2.989\n\nThe unchecked interval is where the graph is [[decreasing]]. Ren is moving down from d(0.335)= [[10.941+-0.1]] meters to d(2.556)=[[-1.623+-0.1]] meters.\n\nNotice the [[maximum | minimum]] is where the Ren‚Äôs path changes from increasing to decreasing heights.  The minimum is where Ren‚Äôs path changes from decreasing to increasing.\n\n    // NOTES\n    // Not sure where to put the comment, so putting it here. I like how in the 1st example, students see the graph being made as the video is playing. Maybe at the end of this section, something similar could happen? They have the graph labeled with the cards correctly. Then, the graph goes away and the cards stay in place. Then, they hit play on the video and see the graph made in real time as they watch the dive?"

      "content": "Let‚Äôs think about the input and output values for d(x). Recall [__domain__](gloss:domain) is the set of all possible input values for d(x). One method for finding the domain is starting with the set of Real numbers and narrowing the set down to a reasonable range for the given situation.\n\nRen‚Äôs horizontal distance starts at the diving platform and ends where she resurfaces in the pool. We know the diving platform is at x=[[0]] meters. She resurfaces at x= [[2.989]] meters. Therefore, we can write the domain as [[0<=x<=2.989 | 0<=x<=10.941 | 0<x<2.989]]. {.fixme} SHOW AFTER PREVIOIUS BLANKS FILLED  Note that the endpoints, 0 and 2.989, are included in the domain using <= and >=.\n\nRecall [__range__](gloss:range) is the set of all heights Ren travels. Notice that Ren goes below the surface of the water. In fact, we can use the function‚Äôs [[minimum | maximum | horizontal intercept | vertical intercept]] to determine the lower bound on the range.  The minimum d(x) is [[-1.623]] meters.\n\nSimilarly, the maximum d(x) gives us the upper bound on the range. Therefore, the range is [[-2]] <= d(x) <= [[10.941]]."

The teams engage in a beautiful [volley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4ux0jau_ws) (5:56-6:01). As you watch the video, notice the shape of the graph. Is it what you expect?\n\n    // NOTES\n    // Students watch the video of the volley and the graph appears simultaneously.\n    // I'm thinking students can use estimates for y-values. The times should be pretty close to the video, but the heights should just be correct relative to each other (e.g. the second relative max is higher than the first and lower than the third). We can have the net height on the graph for reference.\n    // We make this graph, add discussion.\n\n[sketch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mrT-d6Xwunc6I6hC7y2U_38bWR1y-lF5/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThe graph shows the volley as a function of [[time | distance | height]]. That means for at each moment, the ball has a position marked by [[(time, height) | (height, time)]]. For example, the ball is [[9+-.5 ]] feet high at 2 seconds. We can find information about _when_ certain things happen.\n\nFor instance, the ball spends about [[3.5+-.5]] seconds above the net. Brazil scores a point after about [[4.75+-.5]] seconds. Italy places a beautiful set at about [[3]] seconds. The ball reaches its maximum height, about [[11+-1]] feet, off of the set.\n\nNotice that the graph does not show when the ball changes direction. This could happen if the graph were a function of [[distance | height | time]].  Such a graph would tell us _where_ certain things happen. We can‚Äôt tell by looking at this graph which side of the net the ball is on.\n\n___\n\n### Creating Graphs\n\n    // NOTES\n    // From David re: diving graph. Capturing idea.\n    // Great graph. I really like how you included the part under the water. That's nice to show. I wonder if before showing the graph, students could draw the shape they think the graph would be? Maybe have an image of a diving board at the 10 meter mark and they use like a \"scribble\" or \"line\" tool to draw in the line they think the graph will be. Then, when they are done, the graph you have gets superimposed on their graph and their line fades away.\n    // Create videos similar to the ball bouncing activity here: https://curriculum.illustrativemathematics.org/HS/teachers/1/4/8/index.html\n    // Students place a point on the coordinate plane and label it with a key feature name. The might also be able to place approximate points on the internals of increase and decrease. Students click ‚Äúgraph‚Äù, or some such button, to see a line connect the points according to their labels. Once students see the graph, they can choose to edit or submit for checking.\n    // Alternate interactive ideas\n    // Give components of this similar to the piecing it together activity. [This is the same idea](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://curriculum.illustrativemathematics.org/HS/teachers/1/4/12/index.html&sa=D&ust=1595249230079000&usg=AFQjCNFlsjZxKJ9PGN9cluHSZm-OAFBaOA) used in the next chapter for building the tri graph.\n\nThe women‚Äôs pole vault is just about to start.

We can do a similar analysis for each pair of functions.\n\nLooking at the three functions on the coordinate plane, we can see that the relationship between u(t) and g(t) changes from g(t)>u(t) to u(t)>g(t) when [[Rogers passes Tracey | Tracey passes Rogers | Rogers passes Boufaarirane | Boufaarirane passes Rogers]]. This means that the upper bound on g(t)>u(t) is where g(t) [[= | < | >]] u(t), which is t=[[110+-0.2]] seconds.

That is, we want to use a specific section of one function and a specific section of another. The domain values for the piecewise function describing this path are:\n\nh(x)= \\begin{matrix}-x & x [[\\ge]]\\ [[0]] \\\\x & x\\ [[<]]\\ [[0]]\\end{matrix}\n\n:::\n\nThere is actually another way to express the same shape using a different function.\n\n[https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vyl1ggpfxc](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vyl1ggpfxc)\n\n[https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ihajfmgvkl](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ihajfmgvkl)\n\nThis [v-shaped graph](target:1_absGraph) is called an absolute value function. As you can see, the shape is the same as the one described by the piecewise function. In addition to function notation, it uses bars to mean absolute value. Recall that [**absolute value**](gloss:absolute-value) is the distance between the given number and zero. In other words, absolute value of any number is not negative. The same idea applies to this function.\n\nf(x)=|x|\n\nAbsolute value functions have many of the same key features we have been looking at through the functions course. The platform is at a key point called the [vertex](gloss:graph-vertex) of a graph. It is the turning point in all absolute value graphs. The vertex of this absolute value function is at ([[0]], [[0]]).\n\nNow Mathipong wouldn't be much of a game if the ball always fell from the same spot and the target never moved. Likewise, absolute vallue functions wouldn't be very useful if they only ever occured with the rule f(x)=|x|. Let's have a look at how they move around the coordinate plane.\n\n    // NOTES\n    // This section will likely work better with some animations. The graphs here can be mock-ups of key points in the animations.\n\nSo far, when we have been graphing functions, we have been either plotting points on the line and connecting them with a line, or we have been finding a significant point, like the y-intercept or x-intercept and counting the slope to construct the line.

Editors may strike.\n\nLet's take a look at how the idea of absolute value can relate to data analysis. There is an kind of measurement called absolute error that quantifies the difference between an expected value and a measured value. For example, we know our thermometer has an error of 2 degrees. The thermometer says it is 25 C right now. We can use absolute values to determine what the lowest and highest possible temperatures the air could be given the error on the theromometer.\n\nLet x represent the actual temperature while 25 is the measured temperature. Their difference gives us the error, which we know is 2. Therefore, we can use the equation |x-25|=2 to determine the possible actual temperatures.\n\nRecall that absolute value measures the distance from zero. This means that that measurement can go in the positive direction **or** in the negative direction. We don't actually know the intended direction when we are given a value like *absolute error is 5*. To account for this, we need to look at both options.\n\n    // NOTES\n    // Algebra Flow.

Thistlegorm is one of the top 10 wreck diving sites in the world. This British Merchant Navy ship sank on 6 October, 1941 during the Second World War. Jacques Cousteau discovered her wreck site in the early 1950s.\n\n::: column.grow\n\nThis is the depth profile of a typical dive to the SS Thistlegorm. We call a graph like this one a **position** function. The y-values tell us where the diver is in relation to the the surface of the water, while the x-axis tell us *when* they are at any given position.\n\nThe diver's maximum depth was about [[30+-.25]] meters about [[40+-2]] minutes into the dive. Let's take a look at other key features in this graph. They will give us areas to focus on as we think about whether the diver ascended at a safe rate. Label the graph with each key feature.\n\n::: column(width=240)\n\n![](/content/functions/images/6/Screenshot_2020-07-09_at_13.30.23.png)\n\n{.fixme} The above is a mock-up of a more realistic profile.

These seemingly random highs and lows are called \"noise\". Many different factors can contribute to data like this. GPS readings often have noise because of lapses in connection between the diver's computer and the satellites.\n\nWe can use average rates of change to smooth out this graph just like we did in the COVID-19 graph above.\n\n::: column(width=240)\n\n![](/content/functions/images/6/Screenshot_2020-07-09_at_13.52.19.png)\n\n{.fixme} The above is a mock-up of a more realistic profile.

These two points give us enough information to calculate the diver's **average rate of change** of [[2]] meters per minute, well below the threshold of 10-15 meters per minute. So far, it seems like this diver prevents decompression illness.\n\n::: column(width=240)\n\n![](/content/functions/images/6/Screenshot_2020-07-09_at_13.56.16.png)\n\n{.fixme} The above is a mock-up of a more realistic profile.

This diver seems to have taken breaks along the way.\n\nThis begs the question - did the diver ever exceed the recommended ascent rate?\n\n:::\n\nTo answer this question, we can [place points](target:1_point, target:2_point) on the graph indicating the segments we want to isolate. The line running through two of these two points is called a [secant](gloss:secant) line. We can compare the **secant** to the  actual graph. The [distance](target:1_distance) between the two gives us a sense for how accurate the average rate of change between the two points is compared to what the graph shows is happening.\n\nUse the slider to see how changing the number of averages affects the relative average rates of change.\n\n{.fixme} Approximate states for slider.

      "content": "### Space Shuttle Discovery\n\n{.fixme} Data from: https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/522588main_AP_ED_Phys_ShuttleLaunch.pdf\n\nThe Space Shuttle *Discovery* is one of the space shuttles in NASA's space shuttle program. Discovery alone launched and landed 39 times in about 27 years between 1984 and 2011. It's missions included both research and assembly missions for the International Space Station.\n\nSpace shuttle flights like the Discovery's are split into four phases: ascent, entry, orbit, and rendezvous. This is the [altitude graph](target:1_altgraph) for the ascent phase of one of the Discovery's missions.  The space shuttle needs to reach at least 7.85 kilometres per second in order to attain orbit. We will need the speed graph to determine if and when the Discovery reaches this speed.\n\n{.fixme} Students use the same tangent tool as above to make the speed graph. Images below are state mock-ups.\n\n![](/content/functions/images/6/Screenshot_2020-07-08_at_15.09.45.png)\n\nThe x-axis would be easier to read if gridlines were at the minute (e.g. 60, 120, etc).\n\n![](/content/functions/images/6/Screenshot_2020-07-08_at_14.53.25.png)\n\nThe Discovery does reach the required speed at about [[470+-10]] seconds.  It only takes about [[25+-5]] seconds to break the sound barrier at 343 meters per second. That's an incredible change in speed. The space shuttle goes from 0 to over 343 meters per second in about half a minute. That kind of [acceleration](gloss:acceleration) will flatten an astronaut to their seat.\n\nIn fact, the safety of the crew and equipment requires the shuttle's acceleration to stay under 29 meters per `second^2`.\n\nWe typically think of acceleration in terms of fast cars. Think \"This Ferrari goes from 0 to 100 kilometres per hour in 2.4 seconds!\" **Acceleration** is actually the derivative of speed. That means acceleration measures the change of speed during a certain time. Let's see how close to the safety limit of 29 meters per `second^2`.\n\n{.fixme} Students use the same tangent tool as above to make the acceleration graph.

Remember that it only take the Discovery about 30 seconds to break the speed of sound. The acceleration at 30 seconds is [[17+-2]] meters per `second^2`, not even close to the maximum acceleration the crew and shuttle experience later in the ascent phase.\n\nThe ascent phase of the mission include several events between lift-off and reaching orbit. Small variations in the position and velocity graphs show as large jumps in the acceleration graph. Drag the events to their corresponding locations on the acceleration graph. Some events are single points on the graph and others are entire sections of the graph.\n\n{.fixme} design cards for each line below\n\n::: column(width=100)\n\nSpace shuttle lift-off\n\nSolid Rocket Booster separation\n\nMain Engine Cutoff\n\n::: column(width=100)\n\nSpace Shuttle Main Engines provide smoothly changing acceleration\n\nExternal Tank Separation\n\n::: column(width=100)\n\nNegative rate of change of acceleration (large air drag)\n\nConstant acceleration (3 g‚Äôs)\n\nOn orbit\n\n:::"
