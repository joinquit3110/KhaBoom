The sarcophagus\nis still sealed and contains the mummy of a Pharaoh.\n\nAfter cataloguing every item in the tomb and carefully transporting them to a\nnearby museum, they try to answer their most pressing question: who is this\nPharaoh, and when did he die?\n\n::: column(width=300)\n\n    x-img(src=\"images/egypt.jpg\" alt=\"Egyptian Tomb\" lightbox width=300 height=312)\n\n:::\n\nUnfortunately, none of the drawings and inscriptions on the walls of the tomb\nseem to contain any names or dates. However, there is an ingenious method to\naccurately determine the age of ancient artefacts like mummies or fossils,\nwhich solely relies on physics and mathematics: __Carbon dating__.\n[Continue](btn:next)"
