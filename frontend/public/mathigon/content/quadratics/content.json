Engineers have\nbeen working on a brand new model, the _SquareBoard_, which is finally ready to\nstart production. You’ve been put in charge of finding the optimal resale price\nfor the skateboards – and it turns out that building them is not cheap:\n\n* The tools and machines required to construct skateboards cost \\$5,000. This is\n  often called a __fixed cost__.\n* Every skateboard costs additional \\$30 worth of of wood, other materials,\n  and salary for the employees. This is often called a __variable cost__.\n\nIn other words, the __cost__ of producing _n_ skateboards is\n\n{.text-center.no-voice} [cost](pill:orange) = _{x-equation(solution=\"5000+30×n\")}_."

For example, addition and subtraction are opposites, and\nmultiplication and [[division|addition|square roots]] are opposites. The opposite\nof squaring a number is taking the square root. For example, `5^2 = 25`, so `sqrt(25) = 5`.\n\nThis can help us to solve some simple quadratic equations:\n\n{.text-center} `x^2 - 25 = 0`\n\nFirst, we isolate `x^2` on one side of the equation:\n\n{.text-center} `x^2 = 25`\n\nNow we take square roots of both sides, remembering to add a ±:\n\n{.text-center}\n`x = +- sqrt(25)`\n`x = +- 5`\n\nSometimes we have to do a bit more work to isolate `x^2`:\n\n* For every value of `x^2`, there are [[two|three|one]] possible values of `x`:\n  a positive and a negative one. For example, if `x^2=`${x*x}{x|4|2,10,1}, we\n  don't know if `x=`${x} or `x=`${'–'+x}. In this case, the quadratic equation\n  has two solutions.\n\n* {.reveal(when=\"blank-0\")} Square numbers are always positive.

So … If we don’t like that, let’s change it!\n\nPerhaps the easiest way to create an even number in the middle is to multiply\neverything through by 2, so x2+3x+1=5 becomes:\n\n2x2+6x+2=10.\n\nCOMMENT: Some students might say it would be simpler to add x to both sides to\nthen obtain x2+4x+1=5+x. But then we have x’s on both sides of the equation,\nwhich is annoying.\n\nOkay … Let’s try the box method on 2x2+6x+2=10.\n\n|      | `x`    |  |\n| `2x` | `2x^2` |  |\n|      |        |  |\n{.q-grid}\n\n\nBut we have a problem now with the very first piece of the equation: We need\ntwo symmetrical terms that multiply together to make 2x2. Most students would\nsuggest 2x and x, but this right away ruins the square method we’ve been\nfollowing in levels 1, 2, and 3.\n\nALTERNATIVE IDEA: Instead of multiplying through by 2, multiply through by 4.\n\nThis again makes the middle term even AND solves the problem with the first\nterm.

Adding 5 to both sides\nof the equation 4x2+12+9=20 yields:\n\n4x2+12x+9=25.\n\nThe box shows that  4x2+12x+9 is really (2x+3)2, so we have a level 1 problem:\n\n(2x+3)2=25\n2x+3=5    or    2x+3=−5\n2x=2    or    2x=−8\nx=1    or    x=−4  □\n\nIF THE MIDDLE TERM IS ODD, MULTIPLYING THROUGH BY 4 IS A CLEVER IDEA!"

There is\nno way you can get 0 by multiplying two numbers which are _both not 0_.\n\n{.todo} Image\n\nIn our example, this means that either `x = 0`, or `(x-4) = 0`. Therefore\nthe quadratic equation has two solutions: `x=0` and `x=`[[4]].\n\n{.todo} Exercises\n\nHere is another quadratic equation that can be solved using factoring:\n\n{.text-center} `x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0`\n\nUnlike before, we cannot just factor out _x_, because we'd still have the\n5 at the end left over. Our solution needs to be a bit more clever:\n\n{.text-center} `(x - 3)(x - 2) = 0`\n\nIf you expand those brackets, you will find that it is exactly the same.\nBut now we can use the same trick for a product that is 0, to find that\nthe quadratic equation has two solutions: `x=`[[3]] or `x=`[[2]].\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn't explain how we found two numbers 2 and 3 that\njust _happened_ to work in the equation above. To work that out, we can\nwork backwards:\n\n{.eqn-system}\n| `(x - P)(x - Q)` | `= 0` |\n| `x^2 - Qx - Px + P*Q` | `= 0` |\n| `x^2 - (P+Q)x + P*Q` | `= 0` |\n\n{.todo} Let's start by revising how to simplify terms with brackets. For example\nThe trick is simply to add up all possible pairs of numbers, while taking\ncare to respect all minus signs:\n\nNow, if we have a quadratic equation like `x^2-8x+15=0`, we can just compare\nthe coefficient to see that we want P+Q=8 and P*Q=15. After a little bit of\nguesswork and trying different possibilities, we might find that one possible\nsolution is P=3 and Q=5. Therefore,\n\n{.eqn-system}\n| `x^2-8x+15` | `= 0` |\n| `(x-3)(x-5)` | `= 0` |\n| `x-3=0` or `x-5` | `= 0` |\n| `x=3` or `x` | `= 5` |\n\nFinding the numbers P and Q always takes a little bit of guesswork, but in\nall the examples below it should be relatively straightforward.\n\n{.todo} Exercises!\n\nTry to find the missing number in these factorisation examples:\n\n{.text-center}\nx^2 + 3x + 2 = (x+1)(x+[[1]])\nx^2 + 5x + 4 = (x+4)(x+[[1]])\nx^2 - 8x + 15 = (x-3)(x-[[1]])\nx^2 - 5x - 14 = (x+2)(x-[[1]])\n\n{.todo} Some quadratic equations look completely ordinary to start with,\nbut when we factorise them, we're only left with a single bracket:\nIn these cases there is just a single solution for the quadratic equation.\n\n{.todo} And finally, some quadratic equations actually have a coefficient\nin front of . This makes the factorisation a bit more difficult,\nbut it still works the same way:\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n## The Quadratic Formula\n\n\n    // https://betterexplained.com/articles/quadratic-formula/\n\nCompleting the square can be tricky, and it is easy to make mistakes along the\nway.\n\nLet's follow the steps when completing the square, but use _a_, _b_ and _c_\nas coefficients for the quadratic equation, rather than actual numbers:\n\nCompleting the square is long and complicated, and it is easy to make mistakes.\nLuckily, there is a shortcut that makes it a lot simpler!\n\nTo find it, we need to repeat the process of completing the square, but leaving\nthe coefficients as _a_, _b_ and _c_ rather than actual numbers.\n\nLets start with a quadratic equation of the form\n\n{.text-center} `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`.\n\nTo make the first term a perfect square, we have to multiply the entire equation\nby `a`. To avoid fractions, we also multiply by 4. This gives;\n\n{.text-center} `4a2x2+4abx+4ac=0`.\n\nNow apply the box method:\n\n|       | `2ax`     | _b_    |\n| `2ax` | `4a^2x^2` | `2abx` |\n| `b`   | `2abx`    | `b^2`  |\n{.q-grid}\n\nThese steps were ugly, painful, and you don't need to remember them (even\nthough it was just the same as completing the square, just with variables).\nThe result, however, was worth it: a single equation that tells us the\nsolutions of _any_ quadratic equation. It is often called the __Quadratic Formula__:\n\n{.text-center#qformula} `x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/(2a)`\n\nTo solve a quadratic equation, we just have to replace _a_, _b_ and _c_ with\nthe actual numbers in our case, and then simplify the fraction.\n\nSome curricula feel it is important to notice that the formula\nx=−b±b2−4ac√2a represents two symmetrical values about the middle point x=−b2a.\n\nFrom part 4 of this course we know that the vertex of the parabola lies halfway\nbetween any two symmetric points. Our technique of simply looking for interesting\nx-values makes the location of the vertex clear. One need not know this formula.\n\n(But if you do want it … just write y=ax2+bx+c as y=x(ax+b)+c. This shows that\ninputs x=0 and x=−ba give symmetrical outputs. The vertex is thus halfway\nbetween these values … at x=−b2a!)"
