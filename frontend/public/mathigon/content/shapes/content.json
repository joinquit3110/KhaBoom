As shown here in Covent Gardens in London, performers often lay out rope to keep audience members outside of their performing space.\n\n    figure: x-img(src=\"https://st3.depositphotos.com/1817276/19080/i/1600/depositphotos_190806246-stock-photo-london-circa-january-2018-knife.jpg\" width=600 height=438)\n\nImagine you are a street performer and you need to lay out a red rope to mark-off your stage. Pick up the red rope below and create a stage on the cobblestones so that:\n\n::: span\n\n1. You rope off 200 __or more__ cobblestones.\n2. You use 20 meters of rope or less.\n3. The space is fully enclosed (the ends of the rope touch each other).\n4. The rope does not cross over itself.\n\n:::\n\n    // [TODO]: INTERACTIVE-01: Performance area 1 (pages 1-2)\n    figure: x-geopad(width=600 height=400)\n      svg\n\nNow, let’s focus on the shape we made out of the rope and imagine it as a shape drawn on a piece of paper. Recall that perimeter is the length of the boundary, or outside, of a shape, and area is the how much space a shape covers or encloses.\n\n::: .reveal(when=\"rope-drawn\")\n\nYour shape used ${firstArea.ropeUsed.toFixed(2)} meters of rope. So, ${firstArea.ropeUsed.toFixed(2)} meters is the [[perimeter | area | volume ]] of the shape.\n\nYour shape roped off ${firstArea.cobblestones} cobblestones. So, ${firstArea.cobblestones} cobblestones is the  [[area | perimeter | volume ]] of the shape.\n\nThe shape used ${firstArea.ropeUsed.toFixed(2)} meters of rope.

Let’s now think about all the shapes we’ve been working with so far:\n\n    // [TODO] DIAGRAM-04: Parallelograms\n{.todo} Coming Soon!\n\nYou likely notice that all these shapes have [[4]] sides and the opposite sides are [[parallel | perpendicular]].\n\nGreat! It should make sense then that these shapes are called [[parallelograms | trapezoids | hexagons]].  ANY quadrilateral with parallel opposite sides is a parallelogram. Below, click on all the shapes that are parallelograms:"

Another shape that is a parallelogram but we often call a different name is a [[square | hexagon | circle]]. You can learn more about the different names and relationships of all sorts of quadrilaterals in a different Mathigon chapter.\n\nWe are close to establishing a formula for finding the formula of any parallelogram. Our last step is to explore the heights of real-world situations involving parallelograms. Look at the picture again of the Dockland Office Building in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n    // [TODO] DIAGRAM-06: Building measurements\n    figure: x-img(width=500 height=200 src=\"images/slant_building_diagram_2.jpg\")\n\nImagine there is a rule in the Hamburg harbor that all buildings must be less than 40 meters tall. The height of this building is [[28.4]] [[meters | square meters]]. Even though the side of the building is [[70]] [[meters | square meters]], that length [[is not | is]] how tall the building is. So, this building [[does | does not]] meet the pretend rule that buildings must be below 40 meters.\n\nGreat! Notice that the line representing the height of the building makes a [[right | acute | obtuse]] angle with the bottom length."

    },
    {
      "content": "Great! Is seems that this yellow line [[is not | is]] the same lengths as the ladders.\n\nGood thought. Let’s check it.\n\nSuper! In both of these example, we see that the height of a parallelogram [[is | is not]] the same as the length of the side of the parallelogram. Rather, the height of a parallelogram is the length of the line that makes a [[right | acute | obtuse]] angle with the base.\n\nWe are now ready to think about a general approach for finding the area of any parallelogram. Our approach has been to move around parts of the parallelogram to make it into a [[rectangle | triangle | circle]] and then use the formula [[`\"base\" x \"height\"` | `\"base\" + \"base\" + \"height\" + \"height\"`]] to find the area.\n\nSometimes, it can be easy to visualize rearranging the parallelogram into a rectangle and finding the base and height.\n\n    // [TODO] ANIMATION-03: Parallelogram -> triangle (page 20)\n{.todo} Coming Soon!\n\nSo, to find area of this parallelogram, multiply the base of [[10]] by the height of [[3]] to get an area of [[30]] [[square cm | cm]].\n\nHowever, when we visualize the other side of the same parallelogram as the base, rearranging into a rectangle becomes a little more difficult. Cutting it in either of the two places shown here won’t easily give us a rectangle.\n\n    // [TODO] DIAGRAM-07: Parallelogram cuts 1 (page 20)\n{.todo} Coming Soon!\n\nHowever, if this were a building, think about the height of the building. Draw in a line to represent the height.\n\n    // [TODO] DIAGRAM-07: Parallelogram cuts 2 (page 20)\n{.todo} Coming Soon!\n\nSuper! So, let’s see if we can rearrange this parallelogram into a [[rectangle | triangle | circle ]] with that height.\n\n    // [TODO] ANIMATION-04: Parallelogram rearrange (page 20)\n{.todo} Coming Soon!\n\nSo, when we take the same parallelogram from the first example, but think of the shorter side as the base, we see the base has a length of [[4]] cm, the height is [[7.5]] cm and the area is still [[30]] [[square cm | cm]].\n\nSo, to find the area of any parallelogram, we have to first identify what side we want to think of as the [[base | diagonal | center point]]. Then, we need to identify the line that makes a [[right | acute | obtuse ]] angle with the base. We call this the [[height | diagonal]] of the parallelogram. Finally, to find the area of the parallelogram, we take the lengths of the base and the height and [[multiply | add | divide]] them together. So, a simplified formula for the area of a parallelogram is [[base | radius ]] [[ x | + | -]] [[height | diameter]].\n\nNow that we’ve derived a formula for the area of a parallelogram, let’s do a few examples of identifying pairs of bases and heights in a few parallelograms.\n\n    // [TODO]? (DISCUSS: possibly redundant, see source doc comment) INTERACTIVE-09: (page 21)\n{.todo} Coming Soon!\n\nClick on one side of the parallelogram shown.\n\nGood choice! Now, click on the green line that represents the height of the parallelogram.\n\nYes! Watch as the parallelogram rearranges into a rectangle and then back into the original parallelogram.\n\nSuper! Now, click the other side of the parallelogram.\n\nNow, click on the green line that represents the height of the parallelogram.\n\nYes! Watch as the parallelogram rearranges into a rectangle and then back into the original parallelogram.\n\nTo conclude our work with parallelograms, let’s look at two final examples of parallelograms in architecture.\n\nIn 2006, Architects from the firm Tham & Videgard designed a house for an island in the archipelago outside of Stockholm, Sweden. In describing their plans, Tham and Videgard write “The geometry of the plan is generated by the specifics of the site. The house sits on a flat surface between two rocky outcrops” As you can see in the design picture below, the architects had to fit the house in on a flat piece of land between sloping rocky ledges. So, a parallelogram is the best shape to maximize the living space in the house!\n\n    // IMAGE (page 22)\n    figure: x-img(width=600 height=537 src=\"images/siteplan.png\")\n\nHere are some actual pictures of the house:\n\n    // House images (page 23)\n\n::: column(width=300)\n\n    x-img(width=300 height=220.58 src=\"images/house-1.jpg\")\n    x-img(width=300 height=220 src=\"images/house-3.jpg\")\n\n::: column(width=300)\n\n    x-img(width=300 height=409 src=\"images/house-2.jpg\")\n\n:::\n\n\nFinally, here is one picture of the blueprints of the house:\n\n    // IMAGE: House blueprint (page 23)\n    figure: x-img(width=600 height=742 src=\"images/floorplan.png\")\n\n\nUse the information provided to find the area of the house.

This idea written as a formula is C = 3.14 x D. Let’s add this formula to our toolkit.

If you can only buy fencing whole-meter sections, you should buy [[189]] meters of fencing. Only using 180 meters of fencing as we originally estimated would have left almost a 10 meter opening!\n\nSome of the earliest civilizations have pondered the question of how many diameters are needed to equal the circumference of a circle. A Babylonian clay tablet dated between 1900 BC to 1600 BC described the number of diameters needed to be `3 1/8`, or 3.125. This is only [[0.15]] away from the 3.14 we established above. The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus from around 1650 shows the Greeks used 3.16 as the number of diameters needed. This is only [[0.02]] from 3.14.\n\n::: column(width=600)\n\n    x-img(src=\"https://media.britishmuseum.org/media/Repository/Documents/2014_10/5_19/595e9f4b_efb3_481a_9257_a3bb013ab718/mid_00366139_001.jpg\" width=600 height=109)\n\n:::\n\nThe Shatapatha Brahmans, an Indian text from 400-300 BC, shows that Indians used 3.139. This is only [[0.001]] away from 3.14.\n\nIt turns out that 3.14 is not the exact number of diameters needed to equal the circumference. In the 3rd century BCE, Greek mathematician Archimedes placed polygons inside and outside of circles to estimate the number to be 3.1418. 400 years later, Greek mathematician Ptolemy used polygons with 360 sides to estimate the number to be 3.1418.\n\nThrough the work of these and other mathematicians around the world, the number became more and more precise. When describing this number, mathematicians would say things like “the quantity which, when the diameter is multiplied by it, yields the circumference,” or other wordy descriptions.\n\nIn 1706, William Jones, a Welsh mathematician, simplified things by using a letter of the Greek alphabet to stand for this number. The greek work “perimetros” roughly translates to “around” so Jones used the first letter of the word “perimetros.” The Greek alphabet uses different symbols than the English alphabet. In Greek, “perimetros” is written περίμετρος. The first letter of this word is `pi` and pronounced “Pi” in English. Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler popularized the `pi` symbol when he began using it in 1737. It’s just a coincidence that the English pronunciation of the Greek letter `pi` also happens to be the name of a circular dessert!\n\n::: column(width=480)\n\n    x-img(src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohjUZawOtwng26rN6/giphy.gif\" width=480 height=360)\n\n:::\n\nSo what is the exact value of `pi`? Is it 3.14? 3.141? It turns out that mathematicians have discovered patterns and rules that can determine each next digit of `pi`. Today, mathematicians have programs on supercomputers to determine digits of `pi`. Mathematicians currently know over 30 trillion digits after the decimal point! The first 5 digits of `pi` after the decimal are 3.14159. You’ll learn more about the decimal expansion of `pi` in future mathigon chapters. The most commonly used fractional approximation of `pi` is `22/7` or `3 1/7` since this equals 3.142857.\n\nLet’s not let the ever-expanding decimal expansion of `pi` detract from the simplicity here. The number `pi` represents how many diameters of a circle are needed to equal the circumference.\n\nIn the rest of this chapter, we’ll use the approximation of 3.14.\n\nWe had written the formulas as C = 3.14 x D and C = 3.14 x 2 x [[R | D]]. Now that we know the Greek letter `pi` is used to represent the exact number of diameters needed to equal the circumference, we can replace 3.14 with `pi` in these formulas. `C = pi x blank(D, R)` or `C = pi x input(2) x R`. The formulas are often written without the multiplication symbols as follows: `C = pi D` and `C = 2 pi R`. Let’s update our toolkit with these versions of the formulas."

This could be a good time to step away from your device and try this on your own. Perhaps you’ll come up with a new way to rearrange a circle to show that the area formula is `1/2 x C x R`.\n\nOne way to find the area of a circle would be to multiply the length of the radius by the length of the circumference and then multiply it by  _{x-equation(solution=\"1/2\" keys=\"frac\")}_. However, to determine the length of the circumference, we would have to use another formula. So, while `1/2 x C x R` is a correct approach to finding the area of a circle, mathematicians prefer to have formulas that are as simple as possible. Let’s work with the formula `1/2 x C x R` and see if we can simplify it.\n\n    // INTERACTIVE-08: QA formula sequence (pages 12-13)\n\n| Student Question and Answer | Formula |\n| | `1/2 x C x R` |\n| The formula for [circumference](/course/shapes/circles) of a circle is _{x-equation(solution=\"πD\" keys=\"π\" short-var)}_ | `1/2 x pi x D x R` |\n| When multiplying, changing the order of the items being multiplying [[does \\| does not]] give the same answer. | `1/2 x D x pi x R` |\n| Half of the diameter is equal to the [[radius \\| circumference]]. | `R x pi x R` |\n| When multiplying, changing the order of the items being multiplying [[does \\| does not]] give the same answer. | `pi x R x R` |\n| Multiplying something by itself is the same as raising it an exponent of [[2]]. | `pi R^2` |\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is `pi R^2`. Let’s not lose sight of how exciting this is! Remember that earlier in the chapter, we were trying to determine how many `R^2` are needed to cover a circle:\n\n    // DIAGRAM: Round pizza with square area segments (page 13)\n{.todo} Coming Soon!\n\nWe saw that `4R^2` was [[too big | too small]] and that `3R^2` was a little [[too small | too big]]. We have now proved the exact number of `R^2` we need - `pi` “`R^2`” are needed to fill in the circle. Recall from the Circumference chapter, that we often approximate `pi` with 3.14.\n\n`pi` is a powerful number! not only does it tell us how many [[diameters | radii]] are needed to go around the circumference, it also tells us how many `R^2` are needed to completely fill in a circle.\n\nWhen using the formula `pi R^2`, remember to first multiply the radius by itself and then multiply that product by `pi`. Let’s add this formula to our toolkit.\n\nWe are now ready to answer our original question. Which option has more pizza?\n\n    // DIAGRAM: Pizzas w/diameters (page 14)\n{.todo} Coming Soon!\n\n    // INTERACTIVE-08: QA formula sequence (page 14)\n\n| Student Question and Answer | Area of 1 Large Pizza | Area of 2 Medium Pizzas |\n| Type in the formula we’ll use | `pi R^2` | `2 pi R^2` |\n| The radius of the large pizza is [[22]] and the radius of the medium pizza is [[16]] cm | `pi(22)^2` | `2pi(16)^2` |\n| Let’s use [[3.14]] as an approximate for `pi` | `3.14 x (22)^2` | 2 x 3.14 x (16)^2 |\n| Now, square the radius. | 3.14 x [[484]] | 2 x 3.14 x [[256]] |\n| Finally, finish the multiplication | [[1519.76]] | [[1607.68]] |\n\n::: .reveal\n\n| 1 Large Pizza | 2 Medium Pizzas |\n| Area estimate using area of triangles | 1364 sq cm | 1444 sq cm |\n| Area estimate using `3R^2` | 1452 sq cm | 1536 sq cm |\n| Area estimate using `3.14R^2` | 1519.76 sq cm | 1607.68 sq cm |\n\n:::\n\nWe can now finally conclude that the [[2 medium pizzas | 1 large pizza]] have more pizza!\n\nSome people don’t eat the crust on the pizza.
