The rules at play simple: the ball's acceleration is equal to the force applied divided by its mass (that's Newton's second law of motion) and when it hits a side, the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence (strictly speaking you also need to include the effect of friction, but that's not too hard to do).</p><p class=\"fixme\"> The trouble is that in your average pub setting you can't easily measure the exact amount of force applied to the ball, the exact angle with which it hits a side, and so on. As you make your calculations, this small initial uncertainty can snowball, so that pretty soon your prediction may become so uncertain as to be useless.

The first is the weather. Although weather equations are pretty well understood and are solved by computers every day, it is impossible to take into account all the factors influencing the weather (remember the butterfly). No set of data is perfect, nor are computers perfect at solving the equations. The effects of these small errors build up remarkably quickly. After about ten days it is essentially impossible to forecast weather with any degree of accuracy.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Chaos is also key to understanding the solar system. Whilst the motion of the planets is very predictable, the motion of many of the asteroids is not. Although asteroids do obey Newton's laws, they may well have orbits which move erratically about space. Such an erratic asteroid is thought to have hit the Earth 65 million years ago and wiped out the dinosaurs. The consequences of a similar incident occurring today are unthinkable; the nature of chaotic motion means that such events are virtually impossible to predict until too late.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> In 1887, the French mathematician Henri Poincaré showed that while Newton’s theory of gravity could perfectly predict how two planetary bodies would orbit under their mutual attraction, adding a third body to the mix rendered the equations unsolvable. The best we can do for three bodies is to predict their movements moment by moment, and feed those predictions back into our equations … Though the dance of the planets has a lengthy prediction horizon, the effects of chaos cannot be ignored, for the intricate interplay of gravitation tugs among the planets has a large influence on the trajectories of the asteroids. Keeping an eye on the asteroids is difficult but worthwhile, since such chaotic effects may one day fling an unwelcome surprise our way. On the flip side, they can also divert external surprises such as steering comets away from a potential collision with Earth.</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-16":{"id":"step-16","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-16\" goals=\"\"><p>Phase diagram for pendulum: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MjPFHWul2J0?t=29\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/MjPFHWul2J0?t=29</a></p><p>circles =&gt; equilibrium</p><p>spirals friction =&gt; stable attractor</p><p>Fox + rabbit, dynamical systems</p><p>Poincaré-Bendixson theorem (equilibrium, limit cycle)</p><p>Vector fields, equilibrium 2D =&gt; simple, deterministic, 3D =&gt; not!</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-17":{"id":"step-17","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-17\" goals=\"\"><p>Water mill</p><p>Sinaï-Ruelle-Bowen measure / statistics / forecasting</p><ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ3mJxr2NAY\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ3mJxr2NAY</a></li><li><a href=\"https://bl.ocks.org/gcalmettes/c3363abb74fe219b283782f055b72386\" target=\"_blank\">https://bl.ocks.org/gcalmettes/c3363abb74fe219b283782f055b72386</a></li></ul> <p class=\"fixme\"> Mathematicians use the concept of a “phase space” to describe the possible behaviours of a system geometrically. Phase space is not (always) like regular space - each location in phase space corresponds to a different configuration of the system. The behaviour of the system can be observed by placing a point at the location representing the starting configuration and watching how that point moves through the phase space.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> In phase space, a stable system will move predictably towards a very simple attractor (which will look like a single point in the phase space if the system settles down, or a simple loop if the system cycles between different configurations repeatedly). A chaotic system will also move predictably towards its attractor in phase space - but instead of points or simple loops, we see “strange attractors” appear - complex and beautiful shapes (known as fractals) that twist and turn, intricately detailed at all possible scales.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Another feature of chaotic systems is that they can suddenly flip from one behaviour to another, very different, one. Think about how some kinds of debt can suddenly become a risk rather than an asset to banks. Such a sudden change is known as a phase transition. One way to see a phase transition in action is to play with a tap. Turn it on very slowly and you hear a regular drip, drip, drip. Turn it up slightly and the drips become more frequent and not all the same size. A tiny bit more, and the drips become completely irregular and unpredictable: chaos sets in. Keep going, and the water settles down to a smooth column. However once you increase too much, the water starts twisting, frothing and spiralling: turbulence begins. By steadily increasing the flow we see regularity and chaos, without leaving the world of determinism.</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-18":{"id":"step-18","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-18\" goals=\"\"><ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.dwitter.net/d/12018\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dwitter.net/d/12018</a></li><li><a href=\"https://geoffboeing.com/2015/03/chaos-theory-logistic-map/\" target=\"_blank\">https://geoffboeing.com/2015/03/chaos-theory-logistic-map/</a></li><li>Feigenbaum constant</li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/chaos.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/chaos.html</a></li></ul> </x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]}},"availableLocales":["en"],"biosJSON":"{\"newton\":{\"name\":\"Newton\",\"full\":\"Isaac Newton\",\"born\":1642,\"died\":1726,\"bio\":\"<p><strong>Sir Isaac Newton</strong> (1642 – 1726) was an English physicist, mathematician, and astronomer, and one of the most influential scientists of all time.
