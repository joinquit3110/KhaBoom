Students predict how many pyramids it will take to fill up the related prism. Then, students use rice or pasta or water to check their hypothesis. They fill up the pyramid and pour it into the prism and count how many it takes to fill it up. I found this a really powerful and effective lesson. I wonder how some of that could be incorporated here? I image the GIF on the first slide has some animation of that, but I wonder if there is a way to make students do it? There could be an empty square based pyramid and an empty cuboid and the fill up the pyramid with water by placing it under a sink and then they have to drag it over to the cuboid and fill up the cube. Then, they'd actually have to do it 3 times. Not quite as powerful as doing it in person I think, but if they do it 2-3 times, they helps build understanding of the formula. | I totally agree - I was doing the same experiment with my students with the set of geo solids.. I was planning to talk with Philipp about the animations, pills, hover targets in this section. This part has to be really interactive for kids to grab the formula | Jumping in to agree with you both here. An interactive element that really lets students explore here will take pressure off of the language/text. Since this is such an important, and sometimes challenging, concept. It may be worthwhile to require as little effort on reading as possible.And I think all of the slides help lay a foundation for the interactive!</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-87":{"id":"step-87","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-87\" goals=\"\"><x-tabbox><div class=\"tab\"> <h3>Experiments</h3><figure><x-img src=\"/content/solids/images/ch3_38.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></x-img></figure></div><div class=\"tab\"> <h3>Decomposition</h3><figure><x-img src=\"/content/solids/images/ch3_77.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></x-img><x-img src=\"/content/solids/images/ch3_39.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></x-img></figure></div><div class=\"tab\"> <h3>Cubes</h3><figure><x-img src=\"/content/solids/images/ch3_26.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></x-img></figure></div></x-tabbox> </x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-88":{"id":"step-88","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-88\" goals=\"blank-0\"><p><span class=\"math\" data-voice=\"Volume Pyramids equals Base Area times Height over 3\"><msub><mtext>Volume</mtext><mtext>Pyramids</mtext></msub><mo value=\"=\">=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mtext>Base Area</mtext><mo value=\"·\">·</mo><mtext>Height</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn></mfrac></span></p><p>Now we are able to calculate the number of stones needed to build the Great Pyramid of Giza.</p><div class=\"row padded\"><div class=\"fit\"> <figure><x-img src=\"/content/solids/images/ch3_pyramid_3.png\" width=\"326\" height=\"202\"></x-img></figure></div><div class=\"grow\"> <p>The height of the Great Pyramid of Giza is 146.7 m.</p><p>Be sure you do not confuse the <strong>slant height</strong> of a pyramid with its <strong>solid height.</strong></p><p><span class=\"comments\" text=\"(gloss:slant-height)new term - needs definition.
