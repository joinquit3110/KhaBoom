For example, if you roll a die just once, it is unlikely that it lands on a 6 – but you certainly wouldn’t be surprised if it does.

For example, Imagine you’re playing a game of darts with your friend - and you want to numerically know how likely it is that your friend hits the bullseye. You could try to come up with some model to measure his skill, and learn how “good” he is - but a far easier method would be to listen to what his history says. In this case, your friend threw <span class=\"var\">${20}</span> darts, <span class=\"var\">${5}</span> of which landed in the center.</p></div><div style=\"width: 200px\"> <img src=\"https://static9.depositphotos.com/1027309/1217/v/450/depositphotos_12178989-stock-illustration-dart-board.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div> <p class=\"fixme\"> From this, you might deduce that the next throw has a <span class=\"math\" data-voice=\"5 over 20 equals 0.25\"><mfrac><mn>5</mn><mn>20</mn></mfrac><mo value=\"=\">=</mo><mn>0.25</mn></span> chance to also land in the center.

Connect the ones that correspond to the same probability:</p><div class=\"row padded\"><div style=\"width: 500px\"> <p class=\"fixme\"> A friend invites you to play a simple game: you toss a coin a few times. When it lands heads, you have to pay him 1, and when it lands tails, he has to pay you 1. This seems fair enough - you have as much to gain as you have to lose.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> We know that the probability of a coin landing heads is ½ = 0.5. However, once you start playing, something strange happens: the coin lands heads five times in a row!</p></div><div style=\"width: 200px\"> <p class=\"fixme\"> Coin flipping animation, it keeps track of the last 5 outcomes, which are all heads.</p></div></div> <p class=\"fixme\"> At this point, so start to suspect something. Maybe your friend is using a <strong>trick coin</strong> (or biased coin), where one side is weighted, and so the coin is more likely to land on it. But maybe you’ve also just been really unlucky!

Even if the weather forecast says there is only a 5% chance of rain, it might still happen. And our coin doesn’t “remember” the previous outcomes: every flip has the same probability of landing heads, which doesn’t depend on how many heads there were previously.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> However, probabilities become much more useful if we can repeat the same experiment many times. For example, we could flip the same coin 100 times and compare how many heads and tails there are in total. Here are three different coins – can you work out which one of them is biased?</p><div class=\"row padded\"><div style=\"width: 320px\"> <x-coin-flip size=\"120,200\"></x-coin-flip><p class=\"btn-row var\"><button class=\"btn btn-red\" @click=\"flip()\">Flip</button><button class=\"btn btn-red\" @click=\"flip(100)\">Flip 100 times</button><button class=\"btn btn-red\" @click=\"reset()\">Reset</button></p></div><div style=\"width: 320px\"> <x-coordinate-system width=\"320\" height=\"320\" y-axis=\"0,1.1,0.2\" padding=\"8 8 20 28\" axis-names=\"flips,proportion heads\"></x-coordinate-system><p>You've done <span class=\"var\">${numberOfFlips}</span> flips and seen <span class=\"var\">${numberOfHeads}</span> heads.</p></div></div> </x-step>","goals":["flip"],"keywords":[]},"step-7":{"id":"step-7","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-7\" goals=\"blank-0\"><p class=\"fixme\"> In the simulation above, when we used a fair coin (blue) - which has an equal probability of landing on heads and tails. As you can see, the graphs of the fair coins slowly approach 0.5 as you flip them more and more times. But the first <x-blank solution=\"15 ± 5\" goal=\"blank-0\"></x-blank> tosses seem completely random, for both the fair and the biased coins.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Maybe you performed 10 tosses, and 8 coins landed on heads - you might think that the coin is biased immediately! However, it’s too soon to make that conclusion - If you reset the simulation, and keep tossing the coin just 10 times, you’ll see that the graph formed can be very jagged, and each repetition is different from the previous.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> However, If you keep tossing the coin for another 100, or 1000 tosses: you’ll see that the ratio of Heads will always approach 0.5, out actual probability.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> In probability theory, this phenomenon is known as the “Law of Large numbers” - The frequency of an event occurring in an experiment might not exactly match the actual probability of that event, but as the experiment is repeated many times, this frequency approaches the actual probability.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Whenever performing an experiment to find the probability of an event, it’s very important to perform it enough times - Else you might select the wrong coin to wager on!</p></x-step>","goals":["blank-0"],"keywords":[]},"step-8":{"id":"step-8","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-8\" goals=\"\"><p>TODO</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-9":{"id":"step-9","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-9\" goals=\"\"><p>TODO</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-10":{"id":"step-10","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-10\" goals=\"\"><p>TODO</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]}},"availableLocales":["en"],"biosJSON":"{}","glossJSON":"{}","hintsJSON":"{\"welcome\":\"<p>Welcome to Mathigon!
