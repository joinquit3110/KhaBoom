For example, if you decide to take the last two biscuits from the plate instead of one, it’ll mean there aren’t any left for others. But if you leave both biscuits there and go back for one later, other people may have taken them and you’ll miss out!</p><p><strong>Game Theory</strong> is the area of mathematics where we study how people’s behaviour and decisions interact - it allows you to consider what the best decision might be, given what other people are likely to choose - and consider what other people’s motivations are in their decision-making. Game theory often involves making assumptions about how people will behave - for example, that they’ll do whatever will result in the best outcome for them personally - and it can be applied to situations from world politics and economics all the way down to how many biscuits to take.</p><p>As a simple example, imagine you live in a country where they don’t have a strict rule about which side of the road you drive on, and you’re allowed to choose, left or right.

For example, the situation ‘Player 1 wins’ could be represented by the pair of numbers (1,-1) - here the first number represents how good the situation is for Player 1, and the second for Player 2. A draw could be written as (0,0).</p><p>[Some kind of button to convert the information in the table above to pairs of numbers]</p><p>We say that this game is symmetric, since there are equally many positive outcomes for each player.

This is because there is no one ‘best’ object to choose - whichever one you pick, there’s always one that beats it and one that loses to it, and unless you can know in advance which object your opponent is going to pick, you can’t know which one is best to choose.</p><p>If we were to change the game so that there were other objects with different properties, this payoff matrix might change.</p><p>[the option to add more objects to the game which interact in different ways with the ones there]</p></x-step>","goals":["blank-0","blank-1","blank-2","blank-3","blank-4","blank-5","blank-6","blank-7","blank-8"],"keywords":[]},"step-3":{"id":"step-3","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-3\" goals=\"\"><p>In real life, games like this aren’t really this mathematical.

For example, repeatedly making the same choice might convince your opponent you’re going to keep doing that, in which case they might choose their next move to beat you - but you can just switch to the third option, beating them.</p><p>[a graphic showing this where the pairs of moves appear sequentially]</p><p>While game theory can tell you what to do when the other players are all playing rationally and there are obvious advantages to certain strategies, it doesn’t help when you need to predict someone’s behaviour, especially when being unpredictable (like in rock-paper-scissors) gives you an advantage.</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-4":{"id":"step-4","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-4\" goals=\"\"><p>A payoff matrix like this can also be used to explore strategies in games where it’s not just win or lose, and different outcomes can be better or worse for the players - if the numbers involved aren’t all 0, 1 or -1. In this situation, players might find they can choose strategies based on the potential benefits of that choice.</p><p>A well-known example in game theory is called the Prisoner’s Paradox, or sometimes the Prisoner’s Dilemma. In this, two prisoners have been caught in the process of committing a small crime (punishable by a year in prison) and are being held by the police. The police suspect them both of being involved in a more serious crime (punishable by 3 years in prison), but they don’t have enough evidence to convict either of them of the serious crime.</p><p>If they both remain silent, they’ll both go to prison for a year for the lesser crime. If one of the prisoners agrees to testify against their partner about the serious crime, the partner can be charged with it, and if this happens, the police will agree to waive the lesser charges and set the testifying prisoner free.</p><p>If both prisoners agree to testify, they will both serve 2 years (a compromise sentence, as they can both be convicted of the serious crime, but have time taken off for having cooperated). Unfortunately, the prisoners are not allowed to talk to each other, or agree on a strategy - they each need to decide what to do by themselves.</p><p>[Let’s insert an interactive game here, where students can play the prisoners paradox a couple of times, before moving on to the mathematical analysis. The “computer” chooses randomly between testifying and silence.]</p><p>Let’s complete the payoff matrix for this situation:</p><p>Prisoner 1 vv Prisoner 2 &gt;&gt; Remain silent Agree to testify Remain silent ([-1],[-1]) ([-3],[0]) Agree to testify ([0],[-3]) ([-2],[-2])</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-5":{"id":"step-5","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-5\" goals=\"blank-0 blank-1 blank-2\"><p>[For words ‘if they both remain silent’ in the paragraph above (and the one below), and ‘if one of the prisoners agrees to testify’ and ‘if both prisoners agree to testify’ in the paragraph above, when students hover over this part, we can highlight the corresponding row + column in the matrix]</p><p>This places our two prisoners in an interesting situation. The best thing for both of them would be if they both remain silent - then the total amount of prison time served will only be [2] years.</p><p>Now let’s imagine that we are Prisoner 2. If we somehow know that Prisoner 1 will remain silent, we would get the best outcome if we <x-blank-mc goal=\"blank-0\"><button class=\"choice\">agree to testify </button><button class=\"choice\"> stay silent</button></x-blank-mc> (0 years, rather than 1 year).

Agreeing to testify can be considered as being both better and worse at the same time, in different ways.</p><p>Similar paradoxes can be found in many areas of real life, although they rarely have a precise payoff matrix like the example above. For example, this can explain why large companies like Apple and Samsung, or McDonalds and Burger King spend so much money on advertising – knowing that their opponents would take advantage if they didn’t. This is also why many countries have laws against cooperation or “price fixing”.</p></x-step>","goals":["blank-0","blank-1","blank-2"],"keywords":[]},"step-6":{"id":"step-6","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-6\" goals=\"blank-0 blank-1 blank-2 blank-3 blank-4 blank-5 blank-6 blank-7\"><p>One of the four outcomes in the Prisoner’s Paradox has the property that neither player can gain anything by changing their strategy.

Nash showed that such an equilibrium state exists in all finite games - but it’s not always the best outcome for all players (as seen in our example).</p><p>[embedded video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJS7Igvk6ZM]\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJS7Igvk6ZM]</a></p><p>Another nice example of Nash equilibrium is in modelling traffic on roads. Imagine a city has a road network as shown in the example below, with two possible routes from A to D, one via B and one via C. In the diagram, the numbers marked on the roads show how long it takes to drive along the road: for example, the route from A to B takes <x-blank solution=\"1 hour\" goal=\"blank-2\"></x-blank> to drive along, and the route from B to D takes <span class=\"nowrap\"><x-blank solution=\"2 hours\" goal=\"blank-3\"></x-blank>.</span></p><p>In the road network as shown, travelling via B takes <x-blank-mc goal=\"blank-4\"><button class=\"choice\">the same amount of time </button><button class=\"choice\"> more time </button><button class=\"choice\"> less time</button></x-blank-mc> than travelling via C, so assuming everyone chooses logically, half the cars will take each route, and the roads will be equally busy - since there’s no advantage of choosing one route over another.</p><p>Now let’s make our model a little more complicated. Imagine the speed at which cars travel along some of the sections of road depends on how many cars are travelling along it - so the journey time from A to B is now (1 + x/100) hours, where 100 is the maximum number of cars that can travel along it, and x is the number of cars that choose to travel that way.</p><p>[the diagram from above but with the formulae, and with sliders so you can play with the ratio of traffic and see the resulting journey times; B-D and A-C are still 2 hours; for each of the routes ‘number of cars choosing this route’, which have to add up to 100, and ‘travel time for these cars’]]</p><p>So, if one car travels along the section from A to B, it would take 1 + 1/100 hours (a little over an hour), but if 100 cars try to drive that way at once, it will take all of them a full 1 + 100/100 =<x-blank solution=\"2\" goal=\"blank-5\"></x-blank> hours.</p><p>Now, if half of 100 cars take each route, their travel time is (1 + <x-blank solution=\"50\" goal=\"blank-6\"></x-blank>/100) hours = <x-blank solution=\"1.5 hours\" goal=\"blank-7\"></x-blank> for the first section, and then 2 hours for the second half, and vice versa for the bottom route. This situation is a Nash equilibrium for all the drivers, as if any of them switched from their current route to the other one, they would find their journey takes longer.</p></x-step>","goals":["blank-0","blank-1","blank-2","blank-3","blank-4","blank-5","blank-6","blank-7"],"keywords":[]},"step-7":{"id":"step-7","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-7\" goals=\"blank-0\"><p>Now let’s change the road layout - adding in an extra bypass road between B &amp; C, which takes only 15 minutes to drive along. This offers drivers another option - driving from A to B, then down to C, then from C to D.</p><p>If only one car is driving this route, the time taken is a little over an hour for each of the traffic-dependent sections, plus 15 minutes for the central cut-through. This is faster than the 3 ½ hours it took to drive across the top or bottom in the equilibrium scenario, so drivers will choose it favourably. But once more drivers choose this route, it becomes slower. We can model this by trying different numbers of drivers choosing each route, and try to find the optimal arrangement.</p><p>[interactive version of the diagram which lets you change all these variables, now across three routes]</p><p>If 25 of the drivers take the original top/bottom routes ABD and ACD, and 50 take the central cut-through route ABCD, everyone’s travel time is the same - <x-blank solution=\"3 hours 45 minutes\" goal=\"blank-0\"></x-blank> - and if anyone were to change their route, the travel time would increase. So this state is a Nash equilibrium, and once reached, nobody will have an incentive to change it.</p><p>But this is longer than it took to drive across ABD and ACD before the extra road was added! Adding an extra road to the system, which serves as a cut-through, has made the system less efficient. This is an example of Braess’ Paradox - formulated in 1968 by German mathematician Dietrich Braess, who noticed that adding an extra road to a congested traffic network, under certain conditions, can actually increase overall journey time.</p><p>This paradox can sometimes be seen to apply in real-world situations - in Stuttgart, Germany in 1969, the road network was extensively improved to try and reduce traffic, but the congestion did not get any better until a section of newly built road was closed again. In 1990 the temporary closing of 42nd Street in New York City for Earth Day reduced the amount of traffic in the area, even though fewer roads were open to drive on.</p><p>[Image caption: Broadway in New York, closed to traffic for Earth Day in 2018 (photograph courtesy of NYC DOT)]</p><p>There have also been instances of mathematicians recommending specific road closures, having analysed traffic data and travel times, making use of this paradox to successfully reduce traffic. Like in the prisoner’s paradox, no driver would set out to deliberately make their own journey longer, but since they need to make their decision without knowing what the other drivers will do, the best decision in each particular case is to take the shorter route - making everyone’s journeys longer. While the system will end up in a Nash equilibrium - where nobody can improve their individual journey time by changing their strategy - a better equilibrium exists, but it will never be reached if everyone is behaving logically. They might need a little help from a clever mathematician with a ‘Road Closed’ sign!</p></x-step>","goals":["blank-0"],"keywords":[]},"step-8":{"id":"step-8","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-8\" goals=\"blank-0 blank-1 blank-2 blank-3\"><p>You can also play the Prisoner’s Paradox as a sort of game - called the Iterated Prisoner’s Paradox, you can play through this situation over and over again, and instead of accruing years of prison time, you score points based on the payoffs in the matrix.

And the same is true for <span class=\"lblue\"><strong>Player 2</strong></span>. We can colour the positions second from last according to which winning position they lead to.</div><div slot=\"legend\"> And we can do the same again: whenever we can only go to winning positions of one kind, we colour the previous position in the same colour.</div><div slot=\"legend\"> Unfortunately we will get stuck at some point…</div><div slot=\"legend\"> When at these two positions there is a choice: we could either go to a winning position for <strong><span class=\"green\">Player 1</span></strong> or to a winning position for <strong><span class=\"lblue\">Player 2</span></strong>. Here we have to make an assumption that both players are intelligent and will play in their best interest. If it is <strong><span class=\"green\">Player 1</span></strong>’s turn he/she will of course go to his/her own winning position and the same for <strong><span class=\"lblue\">Player 2</span></strong>.</div><div slot=\"legend\"> We have coloured the first case <span class=\"lblue\"><strong>blue</strong></span> because <span class=\"lblue\"><strong>Player 2</strong></span> has a choice to go to his/her own winning position. The second case is coloured <span class=\"green\"><strong>green</strong></span> because <span class=\"green\"><strong>Player 1</strong></span> has a choice to go to his/her own winning position. These are the positions where players have to be careful not to make a mistake.</div><div slot=\"legend\"> The same is happens here: <span class=\"lblue\"><strong>Player 2</strong></span> has the option to go to <span class=\"lblue\"><strong>blue</strong></span> and <span class=\"green\"><strong>green</strong></span> winning positions, but – if he plays intelligently – he/she will of course choose <span class=\"lblue\"><strong>blue</strong></span>.</div><div slot=\"legend\"> It seems that whatever <strong class=\"green\">Player 1</strong> does on the first turn, he/she will always end up on a winning position for <span class=\"lblue\"><strong>Player 2</strong></span>.</div></x-slideshow> </x-step>","goals":["slide-0","slide-1","slide-2","slide-3","slide-4","slide-5","slide-6","slide-7","slide-8","slide-9","slide-10","slide-11","slide-12"],"keywords":[]},"step-15":{"id":"step-15","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-15\" goals=\"\"><p>It looks like <strong>Player 2</strong> is destined to win from the beginning – unless he makes a mistake.</p><p>This method is useful for simple games, but impractical if we have boxes with many more chocolates.

The winning strategy for only two boxes of chocolates is easy to find, but things get more interesting when we have three or more boxes. Instead of boxes of chocolates we will simply use piles of counters: you are allowed to take as many counters as you want, but only from one pile at a time. We can denote the various states of the game using numbers: for example, (2,5,4) means there are three piles with 2, 5 and 4 counters respectively.</p><p>INTERACTIVE</p><p>Notice that it doesn’t matter which order the piles are in, or whether there are additional piles with zero counters. For example, (2,5,4) = (5,0,4,2). We have already shown that (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), … are all <em><strong>P</strong></em>-positions, and there is a simple method for determining whether positions with three or more piles are <em><strong>P</strong></em> or <em><strong>N</strong></em>. <span class=\"lgrey\">This method may seem quite unexpected and unrelated to game theory. It arises when you analyse <em><strong>P</strong></em> and <em><strong>N</strong></em>-positions mathematically.</span></p><p>A Nim state (<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, …) is a <strong><em>P</em></strong>-position if the <em>binary digital sum</em> or <strong>Nim sum</strong> of <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, … is 0. Otherwise it is a <strong class=\"i\">N</strong>-position. The Nim sum is often written as <em>a</em> ⊕ <em>b</em> ⊕ <em>c</em> ⊕ … and can be calculated as shown in the following example.</p><p>To find the Nim sum 3 ⊕ 6 ⊕ 7 we proceed as follows:</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-19":{"id":"step-19","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-19\" goals=\"slide-0 slide-1 slide-2 slide-3 slide-4 slide-5 slide-6 slide-7 slide-8 slide-9 slide-10 slide-11 slide-12 slide-13\"><x-slideshow goal=\"slide\"> <div slot=\"legend\"> Above you can see the three numbers <strong class=\"red\">3</strong>, <strong class=\"red\">6</strong> and <strong class=\"red\">7</strong> in different rows and powers of 2 (<strong class=\"blue\">1</strong>, <strong class=\"blue\">2</strong>, <strong class=\"blue\">4</strong>, 8, …) in different columns. We first need to write 3, 6 and 7 in binary, which means writing them as a sum of powers of 2.</div><div slot=\"legend\"> Note that <strong class=\"green\">3 = 1 + 2</strong>. We need to add the powers 1 and 2, but we don’t need 4. Therefore <strong class=\"green\">3 = 011</strong> in binary.</div><div slot=\"legend\"> Note that <strong class=\"cyan\">6 = 2 + 4</strong>. We need the powers 2 and 4, but we don’t need 1. Therefore <strong class=\"cyan\">6 = 110</strong> in binary.</div><div slot=\"legend\"> Note that <strong class=\"lblue\">7 = 1 + 2 + 4</strong>. Here we need all three powers of two.</div><p></p><div slot=\"legend\"> Now we have to add the columns we just created, but without carrying digits.</div><p></p><div slot=\"legend\"> In this column, we have an even number of 1s so the answer is <strong class=\"orange\">0</strong>.</div><p></p><div slot=\"legend\"> In this column we have an odd number of 1s so the answer is <strong class=\"purple\">1</strong>.</div><p></p><div slot=\"legend\"> In this column we have an even number of 1s so the answer is <strong class=\"pink\">0</strong>.</div><p></p><div slot=\"legend\"> The binary digital sum of 3, 6 and 7 is <strong class=\"red\">010</strong>, and when we convert this from binary we get <strong class=\"red\">2</strong>. Since the Nim sum is not 0, the Nim state (3,6,7) is a <em><strong>N</strong></em>-position. Removing two counters from any pile will make the Nim sum 0, so this would represent moving to a <em><strong>P</strong></em>-position.</div><p></p></x-slideshow> <p>Nim has several important properties:</p><ul> <li>Exactly two opponents move alternately.</li><li>The moves and all options are clearly specified by rules, and there are no chance moves.</li><li>There are only finitely many different positions and the game will always come to an end when one player is unable to move. This means that there are no draws and no cycles, which could repeat forever.</li><li>The players have perfect information. Card games often don’t have perfect information because one player doesn’t know the opponents’ cards.</li><li>From any one position of the game both players have the same choice of moves. This is not true for chess, because from any particular position, one player can only move white figures and the opponent can only move black ones.</li></ul> <p>Games with all these properties are called <strong>Impartial Games</strong>. Mathematicians discovered that <em>any</em> impartial game is equivalent to a game of Nim with certain box sizes. This means that the <em><strong>P</strong></em> and <em><strong>N</strong></em>-positions match up, and that there are always the same number of possible moves. A winning strategy for any impartial game can be found by converting it into Nim and then using the Nim sum.</p><p></p><p>Impartial games are interesting to analyse from a mathematical point of view, but once you have found a winning strategy they are not particularly exciting to play – you know right from the beginning who is going to win.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are so many different moves and positions in chess, that it is almost impossible to analyse it using the methods we will develop in this chapter. After just 10 moves, there are over <em>69 trillion</em> possible states, and the total number of possible sequences of moves might be as big as <span class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"math\" data-voice=\"10 to the power of 120\"><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>120</mn></msup></span>!</span></p><p>There are many other combinatorial games. Some, like chess, are so complex that we can’t use methods like the ones above. Chess computers don’t try millions of different possibilities – they play very much like a human being would: analysing the current position and following certain strategies.</p></x-step>","goals":["slide-0","slide-1","slide-2","slide-3","slide-4","slide-5","slide-6","slide-7","slide-8","slide-9","slide-10","slide-11","slide-12","slide-13"],"keywords":[]},"step-20":{"id":"step-20","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-20\" goals=\"\"><p class=\"todo\"> Coming Soon!</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]}},"availableLocales":["en"],"biosJSON":"{}","glossJSON":"{}","hintsJSON":"{\"welcome\":\"<p>Welcome to Mathigon!
