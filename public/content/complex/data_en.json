For square roots of positive numbers like sqrt(9) or sqrt(5), one can simply look for a number that, when squared, yields 9 or 5. But there is no number on the number line that yields -15 when squared. If the number is positive, multiplying it by itself results in a <x-blank-mc goal=\"blank-1\"><button class=\"choice\">positive </button><button class=\"choice\"> negative</button></x-blank-mc> number. If the number is negative, multiplying it by itself also results in a <x-blank-mc goal=\"blank-2\"><button class=\"choice\">positive </button><button class=\"choice\"> negative</button></x-blank-mc> number. As the Hindu mathematician Bhaskara II put it: “There is no square root of a negative number, because a negative number is not a square.”</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Basic and established rules about numbers made solving this equation seem impossible. But this difficulty was not limited to this one problem. The issue of taking the square root of a negative number popped up everywhere for Cardano and his contemporaries. It appeared in the complicated cubic and quartic equations they were studying, but also in simple quadratic equations like x2+1=0. What made Cardano special is that, instead of stopping and giving up, he took a different approach. He was the first to say: <em>Maybe this only seems impossible. Maybe we don’t think we have the numbers to solve this problem, but we actually do.</em> In other words, Cardano proceeded to solve the problem as if sqrt(-15) existed, despite all evidence to the contrary. His solution, updated only to use modern notation, is shown below:</p><p class=\"fixme\"> algebra flow y-5= ± sqrt(-15) y=5 ± sqrt(-15) Picking up where we left off, we can solve the equation for y. If y=5+sqrt(-15) x+5+sqrt(-15)=10 x=5-sqrt(-15) We can then solve for x, using either logic or by substituting one of the values of y into Equation 1. By a similar logic, if y=5-sqrt(-15), x=5+sqrt(-15) This means that either way our two numbers are 5+sqrt(-15) and 5-sqrt(-15). (5+sqrt(-15))(5-sqrt(-15)) 25+5sqrt(-15)-5sqrt(-15)+(sqrt(-15))^2 To verify that our solution is correct, let’s multiply x and y and see if the product is 40. We start by expanding using the distributive property. 25-(sqrt(-15))^2 We can simplify using the fact that adding any number to its opposite gives 0. 25-(-15) To evaluate (sqrt(-15))^2, consider what sqrt(-15) means. By definition, if you square sqrt(-15), you should get -15. 40 When we simplify, we get 40, which proves that our answer does work, if we let sqrt(-15) exist!</p></x-step>","goals":["blank-0","blank-1","blank-2"],"keywords":[]},"step-4":{"id":"step-4","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-4\" goals=\"\"><p class=\"fixme\"> The first and most important thing to notice about this solution is that, with one exception, Cardano treated sqrt(-15) the same way he would treat any other number. In his calculations, he still obeyed known rules of arithmetic, such as using the distributive property when multiplying. Only when considering the expression (sqrt(-15))^2 did he do something that had never been done before. Yet here his calculation also makes sense: if sqrt(-15) does, in fact, exist, it has to be a number that, when you square it, you get -15.</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-5":{"id":"step-5","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-5\" goals=\"blank-0 blank-1\"><p class=\"fixme\"> If this solution seems confusing, you are, once again, in good company. Cardano himself said that using -15 in this way was “as refined as it was useless.” Yet Cardano and his contemporaries could not shake -15 and other numbers like it; they kept appearing in the equations they were trying to solve. Another Italian mathematician, Rafael Bombelli, used the square roots of negative numbers to solve several important and previously unsolvable cubic and quartic equations. Every time these strange new numbers were used in the solutions of real problems, they gained a bit more plausibility.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Nevertheless, most mathematicians of the time still viewed them as meaningless, incomprehensible, or impossible. The philosopher – mathematician Rene Descartes found them so far-fetched he called them imaginary numbers, and labeled all other numbers real. Though many future mathematicians would object to this labeling, the terms ended up sticking and we still use them today.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Among imaginary numbers, there is one that is special: -1. It plays the role that 1 plays in the real number system: every imaginary number has -1as a <span class=\"nowrap\"><x-blank-mc goal=\"blank-0\"><button class=\"choice\">factor </button><button class=\"choice\"> multiple</button></x-blank-mc>.</span> To simplify the math surrounding imaginary numbers, Leonhard Euler gave -1 a special name: i, the imaginary unit. In almost every respect, i behaves like a real number, with one (important) exception: when i is multiplied by itself, it yields <span class=\"nowrap\"><x-blank solution=\"-1\" goal=\"blank-1\"></x-blank>.</span> This is the defining property of i.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> To see the special role that i plays, consider the imaginary number -28. We could leave it as is, but we can also rewrite it as follows:</p><p class=\"fixme\"> algebra flow -1 * 28 Break up -28 into a purely imaginary and a purely real part. i28 Use the fact that i=-1 to rewrite further. i4 * 7 2i7 Simplify 28 by finding the highest perfect square that goes into 28.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> This may seem like an overly complicated way of writing imaginary numbers, but as we will see, it can actually greatly simplify the arithmetic surrounding imaginary numbers. For now, let’s practice writing a few imaginary numbers using the number i:</p><p class=\"fixme\"> -36 = 6i -48 = 4i3 -14 = i14 -49 = 7i -50 = 5i2</p></x-step>","goals":["blank-0","blank-1"],"keywords":[]},"step-6":{"id":"step-6","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-6\" goals=\"\"><p class=\"fixme\"> Though the existence of imaginary numbers certainly seemed a bit more possible after the work of Cardano and Bombelli, it would be another 200 or so years before imaginary numbers would become fully accepted by scientists and mathematicians around the world. It is worth asking how and why this happened. How did these numbers, which throughout history and even into the late 1700s were regarded as impossible, false, and absurd, eventually come to be seen as imaginable, believable, and even convincing?</p><p class=\"fixme\"> To help answer this question, it is useful to consider exactly what was so impossible about these types of numbers. By the 18th century, we no longer associated numbers strictly with counting, measurement, or geometry, but instead we viewed them as points along a continuous line with negatives to the left of zero and positives to the right. Even irrational numbers like had their place in line, although admittedly their exact position could be a bit hard to pinpoint. But imaginary numbers were nowhere to be found. They weren’t negative, nor were they positive, and they definitely weren’t zero. If they didn’t exist anywhere along the line, then where did they exist?</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-7":{"id":"step-7","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-7\" goals=\"blank-0 blank-1 blank-2 blank-3 blank-4 blank-5 blank-6 blank-7 blank-8 blank-9\"><p class=\"fixme\"> The answer came from three separate sources at around the same time: a Norwegian surveyor named Caspar Wessel, a Parisian bookkeeper named Jean-Robert Argand, and one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, Carl Friedrich Gauss. To see the logic behind their interpretation of complex numbers, it is helpful to take a closer look at the operation of multiplication, understood geometrically.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> One way of representing multiplication is as a transformation of vectors (arrows) along the number line. Consider the following examples:</p><p class=\"fixme\"> If we multiply any number by a positive number, we <x-blank solution=\"stretch\" goal=\"blank-0\"></x-blank> or <x-blank solution=\"shrink\" goal=\"blank-1\"></x-blank> the resulting vector, and the direction of the vector <span class=\"nowrap\"><x-blank solution=\"stays the same\" goal=\"blank-2\"></x-blank>.</span></p><p class=\"fixme\"> If we multiply any number times a negative number, it will still <x-blank solution=\"stretch\" goal=\"blank-3\"></x-blank> or <x-blank solution=\"shrink\" goal=\"blank-4\"></x-blank> the resulting vector, and the direction of the resulting vector <x-blank solution=\"changes \" goal=\"blank-5\"></x-blank> when we <x-blank solution=\"rotate\" goal=\"blank-6\"></x-blank> it <span class=\"nowrap\"><x-blank solution=\"180°\" goal=\"blank-7\"></x-blank>.</span> Note that we can also think of the change in direction as a reflection, but as we will see, thinking of it as a rotation is more helpful when we start to consider imaginary numbers.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> In this way, we can think of multiplying by -1 as a pure <x-blank-mc goal=\"blank-8\"><button class=\"choice\">rotation </button><button class=\"choice\"> dilation </button><button class=\"choice\"> translation</button></x-blank-mc> by <span class=\"nowrap\"><x-blank solution=\"180°\" goal=\"blank-9\"></x-blank>.</span></p></x-step>","goals":["blank-0","blank-1","blank-2","blank-3","blank-4","blank-5","blank-6","blank-7","blank-8","blank-9"],"keywords":[]},"step-8":{"id":"step-8","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-8\" goals=\"blank-0 blank-1 blank-2 blank-3 blank-4 blank-5\"><p class=\"fixme\"> With this geometric understanding of multiplication, we can begin to think where imaginary numbers might fit into this picture. We already know that i × i = <span class=\"nowrap\"><x-blank solution=\"–1\" goal=\"blank-0\"></x-blank>.</span> To understand what the imaginary number i really means, let’s also think about it as a transformation. What transformation can we apply twice, starting from 1, to arrive at –1?</p><div class=\"row padded\"><div class=\"grow\"> <p class=\"fixme\"> Subtract –1 twice.

And we already knew that none of these numbers could ever satisfy i² = –1.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Around 1797, mathematicians like Gauss and Argand realised that to find these new “imaginary” numbers, we had to look in an entirely new dimension. They discovered that numbers form a 2-dimensional plane, not just a line.</p><div class=\"row padded\"><div class=\"grow\"> <p class=\"fixme\"> And suddenly, our transformations problem becomes easy: on a plane, we can easily find a transformation that satisfies our requirements. We simply rotate 1 by 90°, two times, and we get to –1.

It means that instead of existing along the number line, imaginary numbers like i exist perpendicular to it. For any real number, you can turn it into an imaginary number by multiplying it by i, the imaginary unit. Visually, this will rotate it [{90°]] onto what we now know as the imaginary number line. Similarly, for any imaginary number, you can multiply it by i again, and it will rotate <x-blank solution=\"90°\" goal=\"blank-0\"></x-blank> again, and return to a place along the real number line.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> When we combine the real and imaginary number lines, we end up with a complex plane. In addition to locating purely real and purely imaginary numbers, we can locate combinations of real and imaginary numbers, which we call complex numbers, at different points in the plane. You can write any complex number in the form a+bi, where a is referred to as the real part and bi is referred to as the imaginary part. Sometimes, the real part is written as Re(z ), and the imaginary part as Im (z), where z=a+bi. For example, the complex number -2+3i could be written as Re(z)=<x-blank solution=\"-2\" goal=\"blank-1\"></x-blank> and Im(z)=3. For each number given below, place it in its proper position on the complex plane.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> As you saw with some of these examples, you can write even purely real numbers (like sqrt(5)) or purely imaginary numbers (like -3i) as complex numbers. In this sense, the complex numbers contain all possible real numbers, imaginary numbers, and combinations thereof.</p></x-step>","goals":["blank-0","blank-1"],"keywords":[]},"step-10":{"id":"step-10","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-10\" goals=\"\"><p class=\"fixme\"> It is hard to overestimate the importance of these discoveries. Numbers that had once seemed like empty, meaningless symbols were shown to have a meaningful and concrete interpretation that both fit in with and expanded known rules of geometry and arithmetic. As Tobias Danzig memorably put it, the discovery of the complex plane “gave these phantom beings . . . flesh and blood. It took the imaginary out of the complex and replaced it with an image.” Just as we had extended our concept of number in the past to make room for fractions, decimals, irrationals, zero, and negative numbers, we now had to extend it once more to make room for imaginary and complex numbers.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> With an entirely new dimension of numbers discovered, new worlds opened up. Complex numbers were invented simply to solve certain polynomial equations, but they actually have important applications in many areas of engineering and technology:</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Electrical engineering Electrical engineers use complex numbers when working with alternating currents, voltages, and electromagnetic fields. // <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering#/media/File:Silego_clock_generator.JPG\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering#/media/File:Silego_clock_generator.JPG</a></p><p class=\"fixme\"> Signal processing Complex numbers are often used in technologies that analyze, edit and even produce sounds, images, and other information. // <a href=\"https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/sound-editing4.htm\" target=\"_blank\">https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/sound-editing4.htm</a></p><p class=\"fixme\"> Civil and mechanical engineering Civil and mechanical engineers use complex numbers to model the vibrations of buildings, bridges, roads, and even airplanes.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Quantum Physics // <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2019-06-quantum-physics-heisenberg-uncertainty.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://phys.org/news/2019-06-quantum-physics-heisenberg-uncertainty.html</a> Complex numbers (and some even crazier numbers) are used by physicists that try to explain the nature of the fundamental particles that make up the building blocks of matter and the forces between them.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Complex numbers played a role in some of the most important scientific breakthroughs of the 19th and 20th centuries. Just as important, complex numbers revolutionized mathematics. They opened the door to new types of geometry that challenged and expanded our understanding of space, and they paved the way for even more innovative answers to the question: what are numbers and what can they be used for?</p><p class=\"fixme\"> In many ways, the idea of complex numbers was the point of departure for a thousand other innovations, questions, and discoveries. But in at least one important way, it was the end of a chapter in the history of mathematics. As we will soon see, for certain types of equations, we could finally say that we had all of the numbers we needed to solve any equation we wanted to. Better yet, we knew for sure exactly how many solutions each of these equations would have. In this sense, it is fitting that the journey to find the solutions to these equations, a journey that went through so many twists and turns, so many fits and starts, ended with numbers that we call imaginary. It is a testament to the role that imagination, intuition, and conjecture play in mathematical discovery. It is a reminder that even the numbers that we now call real had to be imagined first.</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-11":{"id":"step-11","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-11\" goals=\"blank-0\"><p class=\"fixme\"> Now that we know complex numbers exist, it is natural to ask: what can we do with them? Since they are numbers, we expect to be able to perform operations on them: to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, at the very least. But how does that work? How can we understand adding two complex numbers or multiplying them?</p><p class=\"fixme\"> As we know from the last chapter, when Cardano and Bombelli solved equations using complex numbers, they tried as much as possible to treat complex numbers the same way they would real numbers. The one exception to this rule was the fact that <span class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"math\" data-voice=\"_i_ squared equals blank\"><msup><mi>i</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo value=\"=\">=</mo><x-blank solution=\"undefined\" placeholder=\"???\" goal=\"blank-0\"></x-blank></span>,</span> but otherwise they assumed that the same rules of arithmetic that they applied to real numbers would apply to imaginary and complex numbers.</p></x-step>","goals":["blank-0"],"keywords":[]},"step-12":{"id":"step-12","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-12\" goals=\"\"><h2>Adding and Subtracting</h2><p class=\"fixme\"> We can add and subtract complex numbers just like any algebraic expression, by adding or subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately.

With that in mind, let’s try adding and subtracting some complex numbers:</p><div class=\"row padded\"><div class=\"grow\"> <p class=\"fixme\"> (3 + 5i) + (2 + 3i) (2 + 3i) + (2 – 2i) (3 – 2i) – (4 + 2i) (2 + 4i) + (1 – 4i)</p></div><div style=\"width: 300px\"> <p class=\"fixme\"> coordinate system</p></div></div> </x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-13":{"id":"step-13","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-13\" goals=\"blank-0 blank-1 blank-2\"><p class=\"fixme\"> You may have noticed that complex numbers are quite similar to 2-dimensional vectors.

But, it remains to ask, then: why not just use vectors if both can be used in similar ways? What makes complex numbers uniquely useful for mathematicians, scientists, and engineers, as they seek to understand, analyze, design and create?</p><p class=\"fixme\"> The answer lies in the third basic operation: multiplication. It’s not possible to multiply two vectors – we’ve seen operations like the dot and cross products, but these weren’t really “multiplication”.

To understand exactly why those particular transformations occurred, we need to look more closely at the number 1-i itself, and to understand it a bit differently.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> So far we have been representing complex numbers as points or vectors in the complex plane. We have noted that the real part of each complex number corresponds to the horizontal component of the vector that represents it, and the imaginary component corresponds to the vertical component. Though this is one way to describe complex numbers, it is not the only way.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> We can also describe them in terms of the angle that they make with the positive x-axis, and their distance from the origin. We often label this angle , and refer to it as the argument of a complex number. We call a complex number’s distance from the origin r, and refer to it as the number’s modulus. Sometimes the modulus is also written as z, – it’s the 2-dimensional version of absolute value, the distance of numbers from the origin. To see this visually, consider the diagram below, which shows how any point in the complex plane can be represented in terms of and r.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> If we want to describe any complex number, a+bi, in terms of its modulus r, and its argument, , we could use our knowledge of trigonometry to solve for a and b in terms of r and .

In some sense, the fact that multiplying a complex number by 1-i causes that number to rotate 45 clockwise and expand by sqrt(2) is built into the number 1-i itself. If we had multiplied by another complex number, we would have generated a completely different combination of rotations and dilations.

Take, for example, the following quotient:</p><p class=\"fixme\"> 1-2i3+4i=?</p><p class=\"fixme\"> At first glance, this seems much more complicated than multiplication. In multiplication, we just use the distributive property as we would with variables or whole numbers. How can we use what we know about division to find a way to perform it on complex numbers?</p><p class=\"fixme\"> We know that division is the “inverse” of multiplication, so it seems reasonable that in order to divide two complex numbers we <x-blank solution=\"subtract\" goal=\"blank-0\"></x-blank> their arguments, rather than adding them, and <x-blank solution=\"divide\" goal=\"blank-1\"></x-blank> their modulii, rather than multiplying them. This turns out to be true, but the process of converting between Cartesian and Polar forms can be cumbersome. Especially if the complex number is already in Cartesian form, there is a much simpler method.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> You may have noticed in some of the examples above that sometimes multiplying two complex numbers gives a purely real number. As it turns out, there is a way to turn any complex number into a purely real number using multiplication. It relies on a concept called the complex conjugate. We use the notation z* to represent the complex conjugate of a number z. For any complex number z=a+bi, its complex conjugate, z*=a - bi. For example the complex conjugate of 3+4i is <span class=\"nowrap\"><x-blank solution=\"3-4i\" goal=\"blank-2\"></x-blank>,</span> and the complex conjugate of -2-2i is <span class=\"nowrap\"><x-blank solution=\"-2+2i\" goal=\"blank-3\"></x-blank>.</span></p><p class=\"fixme\"> To understand why the complex conjugate is useful here, let’s first think about it geometrically. In the diagram below, drag the two complex numbers, so that they are conjugates of each other. Try to find the conjugates of numbers in each different quadrant, and think about what you notice about each pair of conjugates and their product.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> diagram</p></x-step>","goals":["blank-0","blank-1","blank-2","blank-3"],"keywords":[]},"step-23":{"id":"step-23","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-23\" goals=\"blank-0 blank-1 blank-2 blank-3 blank-4 blank-5\"><p class=\"fixme\"> Geometrically, complex conjugates reflect a complex number about the <span class=\"nowrap\"><x-blank-mc goal=\"blank-0\"><button class=\"choice\">x-axis </button><button class=\"choice\"> y - axis </button><button class=\"choice\"> line y=x </button></x-blank-mc>.</span> They have the <x-blank-mc goal=\"blank-1\"><button class=\"choice\">same </button><button class=\"choice\"> opposite</button></x-blank-mc> modulus as the original complex number, but the <x-blank-mc goal=\"blank-2\"><button class=\"choice\">opposite </button><button class=\"choice\"> same </button></x-blank-mc> argument. Because the arguments are opposites, when the two conjugates are multiplied together the resulting complex number has an argument of <x-blank solution=\"0\" goal=\"blank-3\"></x-blank> and rests along the real number line. This proves that multiplying a complex number by its conjugate always results in a real number.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> You may be wondering how this relates to division, and in particular to our original problem: 1-2i3+4i. It is useful here to think of division as the “inverse” of multiplication. Take a basic division fact, like 15/5=3. Why is this fact true? We can come up with many reasons, but they all essentially boil down to the fact that 5 groups of 3 and 3 groups of 5 are both 15. In other words, division is defined by its relationship to multiplication, and all division problems can be thought of as questions about multiplication. For example, 15/5 can be thought of as asking a question: What number, when multiplied by 5, gives 15? Similarly, 1-2i3+4i can be thought of as asking: what number, when multiplied by 3+4i, yields 1-2i?</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Because dividing by real numbers is much simpler to understand than dividing by complex numbers, one strategy we can use is to take the expression1-2i3+4i, and turn it into an equivalent expression where the denominator is a purely real number. This is where the complex conjugate comes in: if we multiply the denominator by its complex conjugate, we should get a purely real number. In order to keep the expressions equivalent, we must multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. For our problem it would look like this:</p><p class=\"fixme\"> algebra flow Math Commentary 1-2i3+4i3-4i3-4i This method is equivalent to multiplying our original fraction by <span class=\"nowrap\"><x-blank solution=\"1\" goal=\"blank-4\"></x-blank>.</span> (1-2i)(3-4i)(3+4i)(3-4i) We multiply the numerators and the denominators separately. <x-blank solution=\"-5+10i25\" goal=\"blank-5\"></x-blank> We can expand and simplify both the numerator and the denominator.

To make a long story short, because any number has the same modulus, and the opposite argument as its conjugate, conjugates are uniquely suited for the division operation, which is in many ways just an “undoing” of multiplication. Let’s get some more practice with dividing complex numbers by solving the problems below:</p></x-step>","goals":["blank-0"],"keywords":[]},"step-25":{"id":"step-25","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-25\" goals=\"\"><p class=\"fixme\"> example problems Problem Solution 2i1+i 1+i -4i 4i 4-2i-3+2i -16-2i13 2+2i2-i2 i</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-26":{"id":"step-26","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-26\" goals=\"\"><p class=\"fixme\"> So there you have it! Just as with real numbers, we can add, subtract, multiply and divide any pair of complex numbers. We can do this, for the most part, by following the same rules we use to operate on real numbers: the distributive, associative, and commutative properties. What’s more; we found a way to understand complex number operations geometrically; by thinking of them as vectors in the complex plane. In some senses, we found that complex numbers are even better than vectors. In particular, when we write complex numbers in polar form, it gives us a simple and elegant way to understand 2-D rotation and dilation.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> This property of complex numbers; that they can naturally describe expansion, contraction, and especially rotation is at the heart of their usefulness and their beauty. As we saw in the course on trigonometry, there is a deep connection between circular, rotational motion and wave behavior. Oftentimes when scientists and engineers deal with waves - whether radio waves received by your cell phone, quantum mechanical waves that describe the behavior of subatomic particles, or physical waves like the shock waves after an earthquake - complex numbers are the most simple and insightful way to describe these waves.

In surveys of mathematicians and physicists, this identity comes up again and again as the most beautiful equation in all of mathematics. Studies have shown that when mathematicians look at this formula, it activates the same parts of the brain that are activated when you listen to a moving piece of music or take in a beautiful painting.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> It may seem odd to find such great significance in a piece of mathematics. Euler’s identity is seen not only as interesting, but as beautiful, elegant, and profound. If this seems odd, consider how many unexpected and deep connections are at play in Euler’s identity. It connects nothingness (0), unity (1), the imaginary (i), and the infinite ( and e). It connects five of the most significant constants in the history of mathematics; all of which have long, fascinating histories, and all of which have, in some way, revolutionized the way humans understand and work with numbers.</p></x-step>","goals":["blank-0","blank-1"],"keywords":[]},"step-32":{"id":"step-32","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-32\" goals=\"blank-0 blank-1 blank-2 blank-3 blank-4 blank-5 blank-6\"><p class=\"fixme\"> It turns out that Euler’s identity is actually a special case of an even more far-reaching relationship. As you may have guessed, it is not a coincidence that when x=i, the point ends up rotating exactly halfway around the unit circle. As we know, an angle of radians corresponds to a <x-blank solution=\"180\" goal=\"blank-0\"></x-blank> rotation. If we look at other values of x, we see similar relationships.

To rotate the point a quarter of the way around the circle, the x-value needs to be <span class=\"nowrap\"><x-blank solution=\"1.57i\" goal=\"blank-2\"></x-blank>,</span> or 2i.In all of these cases, the coefficient of i tells us the radian angle through which the point rotates. This is why we usually write the expression not as eix, but rather as ei.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> This relationship ends up being true for any value of x.

To find the acceleration, we can take the derivative of the velocity function:</p><p><span class=\"math\" data-voice=\"a of _t_ equals _d_ over dt of _i_ times _e_ to the power of _i_ times _t_ equals minus _e_ to the power of _i_ times _t_\"><mi>a</mi><mfenced><mi>t</mi></mfenced><mo value=\"=\">=</mo><mfrac><mi>d</mi><mrow><mi>dt</mi><mfenced><mi>i</mi><mo value=\"·\">·</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo value=\"·\">·</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msup></mfenced></mrow></mfrac><mo value=\"=\">=</mo><mo value=\"−\">−</mo><mfenced open=\"(\" close=\")\"><msup><mi>e</mi><mi>i</mi></msup><mo value=\"·\">·</mo><mi>t</mi></mfenced></span></p><p class=\"fixme\"> This means that the acceleration vector will also have the same magnitude as the velocity and position vectors, but it will point in the <x-blank-mc goal=\"blank-4\"><button class=\"choice\">opposite </button><button class=\"choice\"> same </button><button class=\"choice\"> different </button></x-blank-mc> direction as the original position vector. At any point in time, these vectors will stay in the same relationship: the acceleration vector pointing inward, the position vector pointing outward, and the velocity vector perpendicular to both.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Students of physics will recognize these conditions as the conditions for circular motion. If you haven’t taken physics, imagine a yo-yo spinning in a circle or a tetherball spinning on a pole. What keeps the yo-yo or tetherball in a circular path is a centripetal force that pulls the object towards the center of the circle: this is why the acceleration vector always points inward. Let’s press play on the diagram above and see how the particle actually moves.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> As you can see, the particle traces a path around a circle of radius [1]]. What’s more: because the velocity and position vectors have the same magnitude, the particle is always moving around at a speed of <x-blank solution=\"1\" goal=\"blank-5\"></x-blank> unit/second. This means that when t=1, the particle will have moved a distance of 1 units around the circumference of the circle. When t=pi, the particle will have moved a distance of pi units around the circle, and so on. This serves to fully explain why Euler’s formula works the way it does. Because the speed of the particle is 1 unit/second, the input, which in this example represents the time passed, also represents the distance traveled by the particle. Because the circle has a radius of 1, the distance traveled by the particle is the same as the radian angle through which the particle has rotated, so we can really think of the input as representing that angle, multiplied by the imaginary unit i.</p></x-step>","goals":["blank-0","blank-1","blank-2","blank-3","blank-4","blank-5"],"keywords":[]},"step-38":{"id":"step-38","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-38\" goals=\"\"><h2>Fourier Series</h2><p class=\"fixme\"> Start by talking about the link between circular motion and waves.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Developed by the French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier, and originally invented to solve problems involving heat flow, the Fourier series has also extended its reach into our everyday lives and into almost every area of modern science. The general idea is that we can approximate or even represent almost any function as the sum of an infinite series of sine waves. It is similar to the idea of power series - that we can express certain functions as infinite sums of other functions - but it is also much stranger, because, again, Fourier claimed that an infinite series of sine waves could represent almost any function, no matter how complicated or weird.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> To begin to see how this idea can be illuminating, not to mention extremely powerful, let’s look at an example. It is the same example that convinced the Pythagoreans that there were deep connections between mathematical structure, beauty, and the laws of nature: musical harmony. When you hear your favorite song on the radio, or listen to an orchestra perform a famous symphony, you are hearing an incredibly complicated mix of sounds. Each note played by, say, a violin, is made of what is called a fundamental frequency, which determines the actual pitch you hear, and a series of what are called overtones or harmonics. These overtones are multiples of the fundamental frequency, and the particular combination of softer and louder overtones gives the instruments you hear their timbre; the character or quality of their sound. Timbre is what makes a violin sound different than a piano, or an electric guitar sound different than an acoustic guitar.</p></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-39":{"id":"step-39","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-39\" goals=\"\"><p class=\"fixme\"> What did Fourier series and Euler’s formula have to do with this? Well, the chord itself can be represented as a sum of different fundamental frequencies and overtones that are unique to the notes in the chord, as well as the particular instruments being played. These fundamental frequencies and overtones can be represented as sine waves, with a particular frequency (cycles per second) and intensity (amplitude). To see a simple example of how this might work, play a note on the piano below. Note both the fundamental frequency (the highest amplitude sine wave) and the various overtones that make up this one note.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Interactive: A piano (at least an octave) that students can click on to play notes or chords. The corresponding Fourier transform of the piano, both the overall sum and the series of the most important individual frequencies and overtones.</p><p class=\"fixme\"> Now play a chord. For example, play the notes C, E, and G at the same time. This is a basic C major chord. Notice how we now have multiple fundamental frequencies as well as overtones, and how the wave representing the entire chord becomes much more complicated. The opening chord of “A Hard Day’s Night” is even more intricate; involving many more notes and 4 different instruments. But the principle is the same: We can break down the complicated, erratic graph that represents this chord into simple sine waves that represent the fundamental frequencies and overtones being played, and we can use this information to figure out what instruments played which notes. To see more about how this works mathematically, and how Euler’s formula fits into all of this, watch the following video by the popular math enthusiast Grant Sanderson:</p><figure class=\"video-wrap\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/spUNpyF58BY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></figure></x-step>","goals":[],"keywords":[]},"step-40":{"id":"step-40","title":"Step  ","html":"<x-step id=\"step-40\" goals=\"\"><h2>More Applications</h2><p>Waves are everywhere around us: you interact with <x-gloss xid=\"electromagnetism\">electromagnetic waves</x-gloss> whenever you listen to the radio, make a phone call, connect to WiFi, or use a microwave.

This pattern gives information about the amplitudes and frequencies of the electrons within the molecule. In other words, the pattern of spots serves as its own Fourier transform that gives us information about the molecular structure of the crystal that it interacted with. Using some clever detective work, along with the mathematics of the Fourier transform, we can infer the 3D molecular structure from the pattern of spots.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_51\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_51</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA</a></p><p class=\"fixme\"> This method has been used to uncover the structure of many important molecules.
