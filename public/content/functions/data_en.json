The game is effectively a digital table tennis game. Pong is so popular that pop culture still references it today.</p><p>These days gamers can play internet-based variations of pong or visit an arcade with an original Atari Ping console.</p><p>MathiPong pays homage to this titan in gaming history.

That is, we want to use a specific section of one function and a specific section of another. The domain values for the piecewise function describing this path are:</p><p>h(x)= \\begin{matrix}-x &amp; x <x-blank solution=\"\\ge\" goal=\"blank-4\"></x-blank>&nbsp;<x-blank solution=\"0\" goal=\"blank-5\"></x-blank> \\x &amp; x&nbsp;<x-blank solution=\"<\" goal=\"blank-6\"></x-blank>&nbsp;<x-blank solution=\"0\" goal=\"blank-7\"></x-blank>\\end{matrix}</p></div></div> <p>There is actually another way to express the same shape using a different function.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vyl1ggpfxc\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vyl1ggpfxc</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ihajfmgvkl\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ihajfmgvkl</a></p><p>This <span class=\"step-target pill\" tabindex=\"0\" data-to=\"1_absGraph\">v-shaped graph</span> is called an absolute value function. As you can see, the shape is the same as the one described by the piecewise function. In addition to function notation, it uses bars to mean absolute value. Recall that <x-gloss xid=\"absolute-value\"><strong>absolute value</strong></x-gloss> is the distance between the given number and zero. In other words, absolute value of any number is not negative. The same idea applies to this function.</p><p>f(x)=|x|</p><p>Absolute value functions have many of the same key features we have been looking at through the functions course. The platform is at a key point called the <x-gloss xid=\"graph-vertex\">vertex</x-gloss> of a graph. It is the turning point in all absolute value graphs. The vertex of this absolute value function is at (<span class=\"nowrap\"><x-blank solution=\"0\" goal=\"blank-8\"></x-blank>,</span> <x-blank solution=\"0\" goal=\"blank-9\"></x-blank>).</p><p>Now Mathipong wouldn't be much of a game if the ball always fell from the same spot and the target never moved. Likewise, absolute vallue functions wouldn't be very useful if they only ever occured with the rule f(x)=|x|. Let's have a look at how they move around the coordinate plane.</p><p>So far, when we have been graphing functions, we have been either plotting points on the line and connecting them with a line, or we have been finding a significant point, like the y-intercept or x-intercept and counting the slope to construct the line. The graphs and their respective equations actually leads us to a new way of understanding graphs on the coordinate plane. We can think of graphing in terms of <strong><span class=\"nowrap\"><x-gloss xid=\"transformations\">transformations</x-gloss>.</span></strong> Let's take a look at this with a lin we are familiar with graphing y=x.</p><div class=\"row padded\"><div style=\"width: 240px\"> <p><img src=\"/content/functions/images/4/Screenshot_2020-07-10_at_15.18.28.png\" alt=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"/content/functions/images/4/Screenshot_2020-07-10_at_14.47.44.png\" alt=\"\"></p></div><div class=\"grow\"> <p>Now graph the line y=x+2.</p></div><div style=\"width: 240px\"> <p><a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/mcwyh3toux\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.desmos.com/calculator/mcwyh3toux</a></p><p>Notice that this line is y=x shift up 2.

There is an kind of measurement called absolute error that quantifies the difference between an expected value and a measured value. For example, we know our thermometer has an error of 2 degrees. The thermometer says it is 25 C right now. We can use absolute values to determine what the lowest and highest possible temperatures the air could be given the error on the theromometer.</p><p>Let x represent the actual temperature while 25 is the measured temperature. Their difference gives us the error, which we know is 2. Therefore, we can use the equation |x-25|=2 to determine the possible actual temperatures.</p><p>Recall that absolute value measures the distance from zero. This means that that measurement can go in the positive direction <strong>or</strong> in the negative direction. We don't actually know the intended direction when we are given a value like <em>absolute error is 5</em>. To account for this, we need to look at both options.</p><p><svg style=\"vertical-align: -0.564ex\" width=\"11.729ex\" height=\"2.26ex\" class=\"mathjax\" viewBox=\"0 -749.5 5184

To prevent this, divers pay close attention to the rate at which they are ascending. Yep, rate.
